Live cohort

Sign up for our upcoming live cohort, where we'll provide **live lessons + QA** , **compute (GPUs)** and **community** to learn everything in one day.

While the specific task in this course involves fine-tuning an LLM for a supervised task, everything we learn **easily extends** to all applications (NLP, CV, time-series, etc.), models (regression → LLMs), data modalities (tabular, text, etc.), cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) and scale (local laptop → distributed cluster). 

First principles 

Before we jump straight into the code, we develop a first principles understanding for every machine learning concept. 

Best practices 

Implement software engineering best practices as we develop and deploy our machine learning models. 

Scale 

Easily scale ML workloads (data, train, tune, serve) in Python without having to learn completely new languages. 

MLOps 

Connect MLOps components (tracking, testing, serving, orchestration, etc.) as we build an end-to-end machine learning system. 

Dev to Prod 

Learn how to quickly and reliably go from development to production without any changes to our code or infra management. 

CI/CD 

Learn how to create mature CI/CD workflows to continuously train and deploy better models in a modular way that integrates with any stack. 

## Who is this content for?

Machine learning is not a separate industry, instead, it's a powerful way of thinking about data that's not reserved for any one type of person.

👩‍💻 All developers 

Whether software/infra engineer or data scientist, ML is increasingly becoming a key part of the products that you'll be developing. 

👩‍🎓 College graduates 

Learn the practical skills required for industry and bridge gap between the university curriculum and what industry expects. 

👩‍💼 Product/Leadership 

who want to develop a technical foundation so that they can build amazing (and reliable) products powered by machine learning.

### Hi, I'm Goku Mohandas

[](https://twitter.com/GokuMohandas) [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goku) [](https://www.github.com/GokuMohandas) [](https://www.youtube.com/c/MadeWithML)

I've spent [my career](https://linkedin.com/in/goku) developing ML applications across all scales and industries. Specifically over the last four years (through Made With ML), I’ve had the opportunity to help dozens of F500 companies + startups build out their ML platforms and launch high-impact ML applications on top of them. I started Made With ML to address the gaps in education and share the best practices on how to deliver value with ML in production. 

While this was an amazing experience, it was also a humbling one because there were obstacles around **scale** , **integrations** and **productionization** that I didn’t have great solutions for. So, I decided to join a team that has been addressing these precise obstacles with some of the [best ML teams](https://www.anyscale.com/user-stories) in the world and has an even bigger vision I could stand behind. So I'm excited to announce that Made With ML is now part of [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/) to accelerate the path towards production ML. 

🎉 Made With ML is now part of [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/), read more about it **[here](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/machine-learning-for-developers)**!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

##### Who is this course for?

Machine learning is **not a separate industry** , instead, it's a powerful **way of thinking** about data that's not reserved for any one type of person. 

  * **All developers** Whether software engineer or data scientist, ML is increaingly becoming a key part of the products that you'll be developing.
  * **College graduates** Learn the practical skills required for industry and bridge gap between the university curriculum and what industry expects.
  * **Product / Leadesrhip** who want to develop a technical foundation so that they can build amazing (and reliable) products powered by machine learning.



##### What are the prerequisites?

You should know how to code in Python and the basics of machine learning.

  * currently working with ML in industry or academia
  * Python ([basics](../courses/foundations/python), [NumPy](../courses/foundations/numpy), [Pandas](../courses/foundations/pandas))
  * ML / deep learning basics ([logistic regression](../courses/foundations/logistic-regression), [PyTorch](../courses/foundations/pytorch), etc.)



##### Why should I take this course now?

Machine learning is increasingly becoming a key part of many products and so companies are looking for people with deeper knowledge on not only modeling, but how to operationalize it (MLOps). It's a major advantage to understand the fundamentals of this field at this nascent stage so you can responsibly design, develop, deploy and iterate on production ML applications as a foundational developer in your respective industry.
