Speed and Scale for DL Training and Inference\n\n[](#extreme-speed-and-scale-for-dl-training-and-inference)\n\n_**[DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) enables world's most powerful language models like [MT-530B](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/using-deepspeed-and-megatron-to-train-megatron-turing-nlg-530b-the-worlds-largest-and-most-powerful-generative-language-model/) and [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed)**_. It is an easy-to-use deep learning optimization software suite that powers unprecedented scale and speed for both training and inference. With DeepSpeed you can:\n\n  * Train/Inference dense or sparse models with billions or trillions of parameters\n  * Achieve excellent system throughput and efficiently scale to thousands of GPUs\n  * Train/Inference on resource constrained GPU systems\n  * Achieve unprecedented low latency and high throughput for inference\n  * Achieve extreme compression for an unparalleled inference latency and model size reduction with low costs\n\n\n\n# DeepSpeed's four innovation pillars\n\n[](#deepspeeds-four-innovation-pillars)\n\n[![](/microsoft/DeepSpeed/raw/master/docs/assets/images/DeepSpeed-pillars.png)](/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/master/docs/assets/images/DeepSpeed-pillars.png)\n\n## DeepSpeed-Training\n\n[](#deepspeed-training)\n\nDeepSpeed offers a confluence of system innovations, that has made large scale DL training effective, and efficient, greatly improved ease of use, and redefined the DL training landscape in terms of scale that is possible. These innovations such as ZeRO, 3D-Parallelism, DeepSpeed-MoE, ZeRO-Infinity, etc. fall under the training pillar. Learn more: [DeepSpeed-Training](https://www.deepspeed.ai/training/)\n\n## DeepSpeed-Inference\n\n[](#deepspeed-inference)\n\nDeepSpeed brings together innovations in parallelism technology such as tensor, pipeline, expert and ZeRO-parallelism, and combines them with high performance custom inference kernels, communication optimizations and heterogeneous memory technologies to enable inference at an unprecedented scale, while achieving unparalleled latency, throughput and cost reduction. This systematic composition of system technologies for inference falls under the inference pillar. Learn more: [DeepSpeed-Inference](https://www.deepspeed.ai/inference)\n\n## DeepSpeed-Compression\n\n[](#deepspeed-compression)\n\nTo further increase the inference efficiency, DeepSpeed offers easy-to-use and flexible-to-compose compression techniques for researchers and practitioners to compress their models while delivering faster speed, smaller model size, and significantly reduced compression cost. Moreover, SoTA innovations on compression like ZeroQuant and XTC are included under the compression pillar. Learn more: [DeepSpeed-Compression](https://www.deepspeed.ai/compression)\n\n## DeepSpeed4Science\n\n[](#deepspeed4science)\n\nIn line with Microsoft's mission to solve humanity's most pressing challenges, the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft is responding to this opportunity by launching a new initiative called _DeepSpeed4Science_ , aiming to build unique capabilities through AI system technology innovations to help domain experts to unlock today's biggest science mysteries. Learn more: [tutorials](https://www.deepspeed.ai/deepspeed4science/)\n\n# DeepSpeed Software Suite\n\n[](#deepspeed-software-suite)\n\n## DeepSpeed Library\n\n[](#deepspeed-library)\n\nThe [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/deepspeed) library (this repository) implements and packages the innovations and technologies in DeepSpeed Training, Inference and Compression Pillars into a single easy-to-use, open-sourced repository. It allows for easy composition of multitude of features within a single training, inference or compression pipeline. The DeepSpeed Library is heavily adopted by the DL community, and has been used to enable some of the most powerful models (see [DeepSpeed Adoption](#deepspeed-adoption)).\n\n## Model Implementations for Inference (MII)\n\n[](#model-implementations-for-inference-mii)\n\n[Model Implementations for Inference (MII)](https://github.com/microsoft/deepspeed-mii) is an open-sourced repository for making low-latency and high-throughput inference accessible to all data scientists by alleviating the need to apply complex system optimization techniques themselves. Out-of-box, MII offers support for thousands of widely used DL models, optimized using DeepSpeed-Inference, that can be deployed with a few lines of code, while achieving significant latency reduction compared to their vanilla open-sourced versions.\n\n## DeepSpeed on Azure\n\n[](#deepspeed-on-azure)\n\nDeepSpeed users are diverse and have access to different environments. We recommend to try DeepSpeed on Azure as it is the simplest and easiest method. The recommended method to try DeepSpeed on Azure is through AzureML [recipes](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/v1/python-sdk/workflows/train/deepspeed). The job submission and data preparation scripts have been made available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Megatron-DeepSpeed/tree/main/examples_deepspeed/azureml). For more details on how to use DeepSpeed on Azure, please follow the [Azure tutorial](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/azure/).\n\n# DeepSpeed Adoption\n\n[](#deepspeed-adoption)\n\nDeepSpeed is an important part of Microsoft’s new [AI at Scale](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-at-scale/) initiative to enable next-generation AI capabilities at scale, where you can find more information [here](https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/exploring-ai-at-scale).\n\nDeepSpeed has been used to train many different large-scale models, below is a list of several examples that we are aware of (if you'd like to include your model please submit a PR):\n\n  * [Megatron-Turing NLG

Installation\n\n[](#installation)\n\nThe quickest way to get started with DeepSpeed is via pip, this will install the latest release of DeepSpeed which is not tied to specific PyTorch or CUDA versions. DeepSpeed includes several C++/CUDA extensions that we commonly refer to as our 'ops'. By default, all of these extensions/ops will be built just-in-time (JIT) using [torch's JIT C++ extension loader that relies on ninja](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cpp_extension.html) to build and dynamically link them at runtime.\n\n## Requirements\n\n[](#requirements)\n\n  * [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) must be installed _before_ installing DeepSpeed.\n  * For full feature support we recommend a version of PyTorch that is >= 1.9 and ideally the latest PyTorch stable release.\n  * A CUDA or ROCm compiler such as [nvcc](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/#introduction) or [hipcc](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIPCC) used to compile C++/CUDA/HIP extensions.\n  * Specific GPUs we develop and test against are listed below, this doesn't mean your GPU will not work if it doesn't fall into this category it's just DeepSpeed is most well tested on the following: \n    * NVIDIA: Pascal, Volta, Ampere, and Hopper architectures\n    * AMD: MI100 and MI200\n\n\n\n## Contributed HW support\n\n[](#contributed-hw-support)\n\n  * DeepSpeed now support various HW accelerators.\n\nContributor | Hardware | Accelerator Name | Contributor validated | Upstream validated  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nHuawei | Huawei Ascend NPU | npu | Yes | No  \nIntel | Intel(R) Gaudi(R) 2 AI accelerator | hpu | Yes | Yes  \nIntel | Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processors | cpu | Yes | Yes  \nIntel | Intel(R) Data Center GPU Max series | xpu | Yes | Yes  \n  \n## PyPI\n\n[](#pypi)\n\nWe regularly push releases to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/deepspeed/) and encourage users to install from there in most cases.\n\n```\npip install deepspeed\n```\n\nAfter installation, you can validate your install and see which extensions/ops your machine is compatible with via the DeepSpeed environment report.\n\n```\nds_report\n```\n\nIf you would like to pre-install any of the DeepSpeed extensions/ops (instead of JIT compiling) or install pre-compiled ops via PyPI please see our [advanced installation instructions](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/advanced-install/).\n\n## Windows\n\n[](#windows)\n\nWindows support is partially supported with DeepSpeed. On Windows you can build wheel with following steps, currently only inference mode is supported.\n\n  1. Install pytorch, such as pytorch 1.8 + cuda 11.1\n  2. Install visual cpp build tools, such as VS2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools\n  3. Launch cmd console with Administrator privilege for creating required symlink folders\n  4. Run `python setup.py bdist_wheel` to build wheel in `dist` folder\n\n\n\n# Features\n\n[](#features)\n\nPlease checkout [DeepSpeed-Training](https://www.deepspeed.ai/training), [DeepSpeed-Inference](https://www.deepspeed.ai/inference) and [DeepSpeed-Compression](https://www.deepspeed.ai/compression) pages for full set of features offered along each of these three pillars.\n\n# Further Reading\n\n[](#further-reading)\n\nAll DeepSpeed documentation, tutorials, and blogs can be found on our website: [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/)\n\nDescription  \n---  \n[Getting Started](https://www.deepspeed.ai/getting-started/) | First steps with DeepSpeed  \n[DeepSpeed JSON Configuration](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/) | Configuring DeepSpeed  \n[API Documentation](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | Generated DeepSpeed API documentation  \n[Tutorials](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/) | Tutorials  \n[Blogs](https://www.deepspeed.ai/posts/) | Blogs  \n  \n# Contributing\n\n[](#contributing)\n\nDeepSpeed welcomes your contributions!
