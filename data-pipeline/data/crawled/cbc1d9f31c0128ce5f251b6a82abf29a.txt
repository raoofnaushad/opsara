Artificial Analysis independently runs quality evaluations on every language model endpoint covered on our site. Our current set of evaluations includes MMLU, GPQA, MATH-500, and HumanEval. Different use-cases warrant considering different evaluation tests. 

Artificial Analysis Quality Index: Average result across our evaluations covering different dimensions of model intelligence. Currently includes MMLU, GPQA, Math & HumanEval. OpenAI o1 model figures are preliminary and are based on figures stated by OpenAI. See [methodology](/methodology) for more details.

Artificial Analysis Multilingual Index: Reflects performance across a range of languages. Calculated as the average of Multilingual MMLU (general reasoning) and MGSM (mathematical reasoning) evaluation scores. See our[ multilingual capabilities page](/models/multilingual) for further analysis.

Median across providers: All quality evaluation results above, including Artificial Analysis Quality Index, are represented as the median result across all providers which support each model.

Smaller, emerging providers are offering high output speed and at competitive prices.

Price: Price per token, represented as USD per million Tokens. Price is a blend of Input & Output token prices (3:1 ratio).

Output Speed: Tokens per second received while the model is generating tokens (ie. after first chunk has been received from the API for models which support streaming).

Median: Figures represent median (P50) measurement over the past 14 days or otherwise to reflect sustained changes in performance.

The relative importance of input vs. output token prices varies by use-case. E.g. Generation tasks are typically more input token weighted while document-focused tasks (e.g. RAG) are more output token weighted.

Input Price: Price per token included in the request/message sent to the API, represented as USD per million Tokens.

Output Price: Price per token generated by the model (received from the API), represented as USD per million Tokens.
