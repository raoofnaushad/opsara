BigScience Large Open-science Open-access Multilingual Language ModelVersion 1.3 / 6 July 2022

Current Checkpoint: **Training Iteration 95000**

#  [ ](#model-details) Model Details 

BLOOM is an autoregressive Large Language Model (LLM), trained to continue text from a prompt on vast amounts of text data using industrial-scale computational resources. As such, it is able to output coherent text in 46 languages and 13 programming languages that is hardly distinguishable from text written by humans. BLOOM can also be instructed to perform text tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained for, by casting them as text generation tasks.

#  [ ](#recommendations) Recommendations

#  [ ](#glossary-and-calculations) Glossary and Calculations 

_This section defines common terms and how metrics are calculated._

Click to expand

  * **Loss:** A calculation of the difference between what the model has learned and what the data shows ("groundtruth"). The lower the loss, the better. The training process aims to minimize the loss. 

  * **Perplexity:** This is based on what the model estimates the probability of new data is. The lower the perplexity, the better. If the model is 100% correct at predicting the next token it will see, then the perplexity is 1. Mathematically this is calculated using entropy. 

  * **High-stakes settings:** Such as those identified as "high-risk AI systems" and "unacceptable risk AI systems" in the European Union's proposed [Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/annexes/).

  * **Critical decisions:** Such as those defined in [the United States' proposed Algorithmic Accountability Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/s3572/BILLS-117s3572is.pdf).

  * **Human rights:** Includes those rights defined in the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/03/udhr.pdf).

  * **Personal Data and Personal Information:** Personal data and information is defined in multiple data protection regulations, such as "[personal data](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/)" in the [European Union's General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu); and "personal information" in the Republic of South Africa's [Protection of Personal Information Act](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/3706726-11act4of2013popi.pdf), The People's Republic of China's [Personal information protection law](http://en.npc.gov.cn.cdurl.cn/2021-12/29/c_694559.htm).

  * **Sensitive characteristics:** This includes specifically protected categories in human rights (see [UHDR, Article 2](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/03/udhr.pdf)) and personal information regulation (see GDPR, [Article 9; Protection of Personal Information Act, Chapter 1](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/3706726-11act4of2013popi.pdf))

  * **Deception:** Doing something to intentionally mislead individuals to believe something that is false, such as by creating deadbots or chatbots on social media posing as real people, or generating text documents without making consumers aware that the text is machine generated.
