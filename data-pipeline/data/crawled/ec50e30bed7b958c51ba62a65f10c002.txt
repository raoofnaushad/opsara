This PR restructures the Mapped Operator and Mapped Task Group code to live in
the Task SDK at definition time.
The big thing this change _does not do_ is make it possible to execute mapped
tasks via the Task Execution API server etc -- that is up next.
There were some un-avoidable changes to the scheduler/expansion part of mapped
tasks here. Of note:
`BaseOperator.get_mapped_ti_count` has moved from an instance method on
BaseOperator to be a class method. The reason for this was that with the move
of more and more of the "definition time" code into the TaskSDK BaseOperator
and AbstractOperator it is no longer possible to add DB-accessing code to a
base class and have it apply to the subclasses. \(i.e.
`airflow.models.abstractoperator.AbstractOperator` is now _not always_ in the
MRO for tasks. Eventually that class will be deleted, but not yet\)
On a similar vein XComArg's `get_task_map_length` is also moved to a single
dispatch class method on the TaskMap model since now the definition time
objects live in the TaskSDK, and there is no realistic way to get a per-type
subclass with DB logic \(i.e. it's very complex to end up with a
PlainDBXComArg, a MapDBXComArg, etc. that we can attach the method too\)
For those who aren't aware, singledispatch \(and singledispatchmethod\) are a
part of the standard library when the type of the first argument is used to
determine which implementation to call. If you are familiar with C++ or Java
this is very similar to method overloading, the one caveat is that it _only_
examines the type of the first argument, not the full signature.")[#45627](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/45627)[)](/apache/airflow/commit/d1b2a4465387e9414e6c15f8df85591136a7784b "Start porting mapped task to SDK \(#45627\)

Whenever you want to upgrade a set of dependencies \(for example all
google packages\) you might deal with a set of dependencies that
are conflicting or difficult to upgrade all-at-once. And there might
be multiple people working on it in parallel. This brings in the
necessity of building the CI image of breeze with a different set
of constraints than the ones in "main" branch of Airflow and share
it with others working with you.
This PR adds the capability of storing a temporary set of constraints
in the repository \(during PR iteration\) and use this constraint
file to build the CI image, rather than constraints from the
repository. It also provides appropriate README.md file explaining
how to iterate and regenerate such constraint files - even
multiple times when iterating.")[#…](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30002)| Mar 15, 2023

This PR restructures the Mapped Operator and Mapped Task Group code to live in

There were some un-avoidable changes to the scheduler/expansion part of mapped

`BaseOperator.get_mapped_ti_count` has moved from an instance method on
BaseOperator to be a class method. The reason for this was that with the move
of more and more of the "definition time" code into the TaskSDK BaseOperator
and AbstractOperator it is no longer possible to add DB-accessing code to a
base class and have it apply to the subclasses. \(i.e.
`airflow.models.abstractoperator.AbstractOperator` is now _not always_ in the
MRO for tasks. Eventually that class will be deleted, but not yet\)
On a similar vein XComArg's `get_task_map_length` is also moved to a single
dispatch class method on the TaskMap model since now the definition time
objects live in the TaskSDK, and there is no realistic way to get a per-type
subclass with DB logic \(i.e. it's very complex to end up with a
PlainDBXComArg, a MapDBXComArg, etc. that we can attach the method too\)

once we move old providers to the new structure, a lot of code
could be removed and simplified.
The new structure for provider code is:
```
providers
    |- PROVIDER_ID
    |      |- src
    |      |  |-airflow
    |      |      |- providers

We are preparing to switch from Buster to Bullseye and this is

allows to choose whether we want to use Buster or Bullseye images
as a base. We need to be able to choose, because:
1\) we want to keep backwards compatibility and continue our
  users to build Buster-base images
2\) we cannot yet fully switch to Bullseye because MsSQL's odbc
  driver does not yet support Bullseye and we reached out to
  mysql maintainers to learn about their plans to make the
  decision on when and how we are going to support Bullseye and
  MSSQL.

GitHub stopped rendering .. contents:: :local: in their UI and instead
opt for expandable table of content that can be shown by clicking
an "index" button at the top-right of the page. It's really nice
when you know it but it's not easily discoverable. Seems that this
is a deliberate choice and there is no going back, so best approach
we can do is to explain it to the users by replacing the index with
explanation where to look for it.

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/) (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

## Project Focus

[](#project-focus)

Airflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the DAG structure is similar from one run to the next, it clarifies the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/) and [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/).

Airflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's [XCom feature](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/xcoms.html)). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work.

Airflow is not a streaming solution, but it is often used to process real-time data, pulling data off streams in batches.

## Principles

[](#principles)

  * **Dynamic** : Airflow pipelines are configuration as code (Python), allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.
  * **Extensible** : Easily define your own operators, executors and extend the library so that it fits the level of abstraction that suits your environment.
  * **Elegant** : Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parameterizing your scripts is built into the core of Airflow using the powerful **Jinja** templating engine.
  * **Scalable** : Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers.



## Requirements

[](#requirements)

Apache Airflow is tested with:

Main version (dev) | Stable version (2.10.4)  
---|---  
Python | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12  
Platform | AMD64/ARM64(*) | AMD64/ARM64(*)  
Kubernetes | 1.28, 1.29, 1.30, 1.31 | 1.27, 1.28, 1.29, 1.30  
PostgreSQL | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 | 12, 13, 14, 15, 16  
MySQL | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation  
SQLite | 3.15.0+ | 3.15.0+  
  
* Experimental

**Note** : MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note** : SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note** : Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS. On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers. The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388), but it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is `Debian Bookworm`.

## Getting started

[](#getting-started)

Visit the official Airflow website documentation (latest **stable** release) for help with [installing Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/), [getting started](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html), or walking through a more complete [tutorial](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/).

> Note: If you're looking for documentation for the main branch (latest development branch): you can find it on [s.apache.org/airflow-docs](https://s.apache.org/airflow-docs/).

For more information on Airflow Improvement Proposals (AIPs), visit the [Airflow Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals).

Documentation for dependent projects like provider packages, Docker image, Helm Chart, you'll find it in [the documentation index](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/).

## Installing from PyPI

[](#installing-from-pypi)

We publish Apache Airflow as `apache-airflow` package in PyPI. Installing it however might be sometimes tricky because Airflow is a bit of both a library and application. Libraries usually keep their dependencies open, and applications usually pin them, but we should do neither and both simultaneously. We decided to keep our dependencies as open as possible (in `pyproject.toml`) so users can install different versions of libraries if needed. This means that `pip install apache-airflow` will not work from time to time or will produce unusable Airflow installation.

To have repeatable installation, however, we keep a set of "known-to-be-working" constraint files in the orphan `constraints-main` and `constraints-2-0` branches. We keep those "known-to-be-working" constraints files separately per major/minor Python version. You can use them as constraint files when installing Airflow from PyPI. Note that you have to specify correct Airflow tag/version/branch and Python versions in the URL.

  1. Installing just Airflow:



> Note: Only `pip` installation is currently officially supported.

While it is possible to install Airflow with tools like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) or [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools), they do not share the same workflow as `pip` - especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management. Installing via `Poetry` or `pip-tools` is not currently supported.

There are known issues with `bazel` that might lead to circular dependencies when using it to install Airflow. Please switch to `pip` if you encounter such problems. `Bazel` community works on fixing the problem in `this PR <https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/1166>`_ so it might be that newer versions of `bazel` will handle it.

If you wish to install Airflow using those tools, you should use the constraint files and convert them to the appropriate format and workflow that your tool requires.

```
pip install 'apache-airflow==2.10.4' \ --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.10.4/constraints-3.9.txt"
```

  1. Installing with extras (i.e., postgres, google)



```
pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres,google]==2.10.4' \ --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.10.4/constraints-3.9.txt"
```

For information on installing provider packages, check [providers](http://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html).

## Official source code

[](#official-source-code)

Apache Airflow is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org) (ASF) project, and our official source code releases:

  * Follow the [ASF Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html)
  * Can be downloaded from [the ASF Distribution Directory](https://downloads.apache.org/airflow)
  * Are cryptographically signed by the release manager
  * Are officially voted on by the PMC members during the [Release Approval Process](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval)



Following the ASF rules, the source packages released must be sufficient for a user to build and test the release provided they have access to the appropriate platform and tools.

## Convenience packages

[](#convenience-packages)

There are other ways of installing and using Airflow. Those are "convenience" methods - they are not "official releases" as stated by the `ASF Release Policy`, but they can be used by the users who do not want to build the software themselves.

Those are - in the order of most common ways people install Airflow:

  * [PyPI releases](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/) to install Airflow using standard `pip` tool
  * [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow) to install airflow via `docker` tool, use them in Kubernetes, Helm Charts, `docker-compose`, `docker swarm`, etc. You can read more about using, customizing, and extending the images in the [Latest docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/index.html), and learn details on the internals in the [images](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/index.html) document.
  * [Tags in GitHub](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tags) to retrieve the git project sources that were used to generate official source packages via git



All those artifacts are not official releases, but they are prepared using officially released sources. Some of those artifacts are "development" or "pre-release" ones, and they are clearly marked as such following the ASF Policy.

## Semantic versioning

[](#semantic-versioning)

As of Airflow 2.0.0, we support a strict [SemVer](https://semver.org/) approach for all packages released.

There are few specific rules that we agreed to that define details of versioning of the different packages:

  * **Airflow** : SemVer rules apply to core airflow only (excludes any changes to providers). Changing limits for versions of Airflow dependencies is not a breaking change on its own.
  * **Airflow Providers** : SemVer rules apply to changes in the particular provider's code only. SemVer MAJOR and MINOR versions for the packages are independent of the Airflow version. For example, `google 4.1.0` and `amazon 3.0.3` providers can happily be installed with `Airflow 2.1.2`. If there are limits of cross-dependencies between providers and Airflow packages, they are present in providers as `install_requires` limitations. We aim to keep backwards compatibility of providers with all previously released Airflow 2 versions but there will sometimes be breaking changes that might make some, or all providers, have minimum Airflow version specified.
  * **Airflow Helm Chart** : SemVer rules apply to changes in the chart only. SemVer MAJOR and MINOR versions for the chart are independent of the Airflow version. We aim to keep backwards compatibility of the Helm Chart with all released Airflow 2 versions, but some new features might only work starting from specific Airflow releases. We might however limit the Helm Chart to depend on minimal Airflow version.
  * **Airflow API clients** : Their versioning is independent from Airflow versions. They follow their own SemVer rules for breaking changes and new features - which for example allows to change the way we generate the clients.



## Version Life Cycle

[](#version-life-cycle)

Apache Airflow version life cycle:

Version | Current Patch/Minor | State | First Release | Limited Support | EOL/Terminated  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 2.10.4 | Supported | Dec 17, 2020 | TBD | TBD  
1.10 | 1.10.15 | EOL | Aug 27, 2018 | Dec 17, 2020 | June 17, 2021  
1.9 | 1.9.0 | EOL | Jan 03, 2018 | Aug 27, 2018 | Aug 27, 2018  
1.8 | 1.8.2 | EOL | Mar 19, 2017 | Jan 03, 2018 | Jan 03, 2018  
1.7 | 1.7.1.2 | EOL | Mar 28, 2016 | Mar 19, 2017 | Mar 19, 2017  
  
Limited support versions will be supported with security and critical bug fix only. EOL versions will not get any fixes nor support. We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use. We **highly** recommend upgrading to the latest Airflow major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.

## Support for Python and Kubernetes versions

[](#support-for-python-and-kubernetes-versions)

As of Airflow 2.0, we agreed to certain rules we follow for Python and Kubernetes support. They are based on the official release schedule of Python and Kubernetes, nicely summarized in the [Python Developer's Guide](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) and [Kubernetes version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).

  1. We drop support for Python and Kubernetes versions when they reach EOL. Except for Kubernetes, a version stays supported by Airflow if two major cloud providers still provide support for it. We drop support for those EOL versions in main right after EOL date, and it is effectively removed when we release the first new MINOR (Or MAJOR if there is no new MINOR version) of Airflow. For example, for Python 3.9 it means that we will drop support in main right after 27.06.2023, and the first MAJOR or MINOR version of Airflow released after will not have it.

  2. We support a new version of Python/Kubernetes in main after they are officially released, as soon as we make them work in our CI pipeline (which might not be immediate due to dependencies catching up with new versions of Python mostly) we release new images/support in Airflow based on the working CI setup.

  3. This policy is best-effort which means there may be situations where we might terminate support earlier if circumstances require it.




## Base OS support for reference Airflow images

[](#base-os-support-for-reference-airflow-images)

The Airflow Community provides conveniently packaged container images that are published whenever we publish an Apache Airflow release. Those images contain:

  * Base OS with necessary packages to install Airflow (stable Debian OS)
  * Base Python installation in versions supported at the time of release for the MINOR version of Airflow released (so there could be different versions for 2.3 and 2.2 line for example)
  * Libraries required to connect to supported Databases (again the set of databases supported depends on the MINOR version of Airflow)
  * Predefined set of popular providers (for details see the [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/Dockerfile)).
  * Possibility of building your own, custom image where the user can choose their own set of providers and libraries (see [Building the image](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html))
  * In the future Airflow might also support a "slim" version without providers nor database clients installed



The version of the base OS image is the stable version of Debian. Airflow supports using all currently active stable versions - as soon as all Airflow dependencies support building, and we set up the CI pipeline for building and testing the OS version. Approximately 6 months before the end-of-regular support of a previous stable version of the OS, Airflow switches the images released to use the latest supported version of the OS.

For example switch from `Debian Bullseye` to `Debian Bookworm` has been implemented before 2.8.0 release in October 2023 and `Debian Bookworm` will be the only option supported as of Airflow 2.10.0.

Users will continue to be able to build their images using stable Debian releases until the end of regular support and building and verifying of the images happens in our CI but no unit tests were executed using this image in the `main` branch.

## Approach to dependencies of Airflow

[](#approach-to-dependencies-of-airflow)

Airflow has a lot of dependencies - direct and transitive, also Airflow is both - library and application, therefore our policies to dependencies has to include both - stability of installation of application, but also ability to install newer version of dependencies for those users who develop DAGs. We developed the approach where `constraints` are used to make sure airflow can be installed in a repeatable way, while we do not limit our users to upgrade most of the dependencies. As a result we decided not to upper-bound version of Airflow dependencies by default, unless we have good reasons to believe upper-bounding them is needed because of importance of the dependency as well as risk it involves to upgrade specific dependency. We also upper-bound the dependencies that we know cause problems.

The constraint mechanism of ours takes care about finding and upgrading all the non-upper bound dependencies automatically (providing that all the tests pass). Our `main` build failures will indicate in case there are versions of dependencies that break our tests - indicating that we should either upper-bind them or that we should fix our code/tests to account for the upstream changes from those dependencies.

Whenever we upper-bound such a dependency, we should always comment why we are doing it - i.e. we should have a good reason why dependency is upper-bound. And we should also mention what is the condition to remove the binding.

### Approach for dependencies for Airflow Core

[](#approach-for-dependencies-for-airflow-core)

Those dependencies are maintained in `pyproject.toml`.

There are few dependencies that we decided are important enough to upper-bound them by default, as they are known to follow predictable versioning scheme, and we know that new versions of those are very likely to bring breaking changes. We commit to regularly review and attempt to upgrade to the newer versions of the dependencies as they are released, but this is manual process.

The important dependencies are:

  * `SQLAlchemy`: upper-bound to specific MINOR version (SQLAlchemy is known to remove deprecations and introduce breaking changes especially that support for different Databases varies and changes at various speed)
  * `Alembic`: it is important to handle our migrations in predictable and performant way. It is developed together with SQLAlchemy. Our experience with Alembic is that it very stable in MINOR version
  * `Flask`: We are using Flask as the back-bone of our web UI and API. We know major version of Flask are very likely to introduce breaking changes across those so limiting it to MAJOR version makes sense
  * `werkzeug`: the library is known to cause problems in new versions. It is tightly coupled with Flask libraries, and we should update them together
  * `celery`: Celery is a crucial component of Airflow as it used for CeleryExecutor (and similar). Celery [follows SemVer](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/contributing.html?highlight=semver#versions), so we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also, when we bump the upper version of the library, we should make sure Celery Provider minimum Airflow version is updated.
  * `kubernetes`: Kubernetes is a crucial component of Airflow as it is used for the KubernetesExecutor (and similar). Kubernetes Python library [follows SemVer](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python#compatibility), so we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also, when we bump the upper version of the library, we should make sure Kubernetes Provider minimum Airflow version is updated.



### Approach for dependencies in Airflow Providers and extras

[](#approach-for-dependencies-in-airflow-providers-and-extras)

The main part of the Airflow is the Airflow Core, but the power of Airflow also comes from a number of providers that extend the core functionality and are released separately, even if we keep them (for now) in the same monorepo for convenience. You can read more about the providers in the [Providers documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html). We also have set of policies implemented for maintaining and releasing community-managed providers as well as the approach for community vs. 3rd party providers in the [providers](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/PROVIDERS.rst) document.

Those `extras` and `providers` dependencies are maintained in `provider.yaml` of each provider.

By default, we should not upper-bound dependencies for providers, however each provider's maintainer might decide to add additional limits (and justify them with comment).

## What goes into the next release?

[](#what-goes-into-the-next-release)

Often you will see an issue that is assigned to specific milestone with Airflow version, or a PR that gets merged to the main branch and you might wonder which release the merged PR(s) will be released in or which release the fixed issues will be in. The answer to this is as usual - it depends on various scenarios. The answer is different for PRs and Issues.

To add a bit of context, we are following the [Semver](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme as described in [Airflow release process](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/release-process.html). More details are explained in detail in this README under the [Semantic versioning](#semantic-versioning) chapter, but in short, we have `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versions of Airflow.

  * `MAJOR` version is incremented in case of breaking changes
  * `MINOR` version is incremented when there are new features added
  * `PATCH` version is incremented when there are only bug-fixes and doc-only changes



Generally we release `MINOR` versions of Airflow from a branch that is named after the MINOR version. For example `2.7.*` releases are released from `v2-7-stable` branch, `2.8.*` releases are released from `v2-8-stable` branch, etc.

  1. Most of the time in our release cycle, when the branch for next `MINOR` branch is not yet created, all PRs merged to `main` (unless they get reverted), will find their way to the next `MINOR` release. For example if the last release is `2.7.3` and `v2-8-stable` branch is not created yet, the next `MINOR` release is `2.8.0` and all PRs merged to main will be released in `2.8.0`. However, some PRs (bug-fixes and doc-only changes) when merged, can be cherry-picked to current `MINOR` branch and released in the next `PATCHLEVEL` release. For example, if `2.8.1` is already released and we are working on `2.9.0dev`, then marking a PR with `2.8.2` milestone means that it will be cherry-picked to `v2-8-test` branch and released in `2.8.2rc1`, and eventually in `2.8.2`.

  2. When we prepare for the next `MINOR` release, we cut new `v2-*-test` and `v2-*-stable` branch and prepare `alpha`, `beta` releases for the next `MINOR` version, the PRs merged to main will still be released in the next `MINOR` release until `rc` version is cut. This is happening because the `v2-*-test` and `v2-*-stable` branches are rebased on top of main when next `beta` and `rc` releases are prepared. For example, when we cut `2.10.0beta1` version, anything merged to main before `2.10.0rc1` is released, will find its way to 2.10.0rc1.

  3. Then, once we prepare the first RC candidate for the MINOR release, we stop moving the `v2-*-test` and `v2-*-stable` branches and the PRs merged to main will be released in the next `MINOR` release. However, some PRs (bug-fixes and doc-only changes) when merged, can be cherry-picked to current `MINOR` branch and released in the next `PATCHLEVEL` release - for example when the last released version from `v2-10-stable` branch is `2.10.0rc1`, some of the PRs from main can be marked as `2.10.0` milestone by committers, the release manager will try to cherry-pick them into the release branch. If successful, they will be released in `2.10.0rc2` and subsequently in `2.10.0`. This also applies to subsequent `PATCHLEVEL` versions. When for example `2.10.1` is already released, marking a PR with `2.10.2` milestone will mean that it will be cherry-picked to `v2-10-stable` branch and released in `2.10.2rc1` and eventually in `2.10.2`.




The final decision about cherry-picking is made by the release manager.

Marking issues with a milestone is a bit different. Maintainers do not mark issues with a milestone usually, normally they are only marked in PRs. If PR linked to the issue (and "fixing it") gets merged and released in a specific version following the process described above, the issue will be automatically closed, no milestone will be set for the issue, you need to check the PR that fixed the issue to see which version it was released in.

However, sometimes maintainers mark issues with specific milestone, which means that the issue is important to become a candidate to take a look when the release is being prepared. Since this is an Open-Source project, where basically all contributors volunteer their time, there is no guarantee that specific issue will be fixed in specific version. We do not want to hold the release because some issue is not fixed, so in such case release manager will reassign such unfixed issues to the next milestone in case they are not fixed in time for the current release. Therefore, the milestone for issue is more of an intent that it should be looked at, than promise it will be fixed in the version.

More context and **FAQ** about the patchlevel release can be found in the [What goes into the next release](/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/WHAT_GOES_INTO_THE_NEXT_RELEASE.md) document in the `dev` folder of the repository.
