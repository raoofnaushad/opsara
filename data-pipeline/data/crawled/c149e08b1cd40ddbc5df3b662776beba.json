I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam.\n\nMy focus is on ML/AI systems in production. Iâ€™m currently exploring creative use cases of AI in education and entertainment.\n\nPreviously, I worked on ML tooling at NVIDIA (core dev of [**NeMo**](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)), Snorkel AI, and Netflix. I also founded and sold an AI infra startup.\n\nRunning a startup taught me that being a founder is incredibly hard, so I try to support founders in any way I can. Some startups Iâ€™ve worked with included [Convai](https://convai.com/), [OctoAI](https://octo.ai/), and [Photoroom](https://www.photoroom.com/).\n\nI graduated from Stanford, where I taught [ML Systems](https://cs329s.stanford.edu). The lectures became the foundation for the book [**Designing Machine Learning Systems**](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=chiphuyen-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=0a1dbab0e76f5996e29e1a97d45f14a5&camp=1789&creative=9325), which is an Amazon #1 bestseller in AI and has been translated into 10+ languages (very proud)!\n\nMy new book **AI Engineering** (2025) is currently the most read book on the [Oâ€™Reilly](https://oreillymedia.pxf.io/c/5719111/2146021/15173) platform. Itâ€™s also available on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/49j1cGS) and [Kindle](https://amzn.to/3Vq2ryu).\n\nIâ€™m active on [GitHub](https://github.com/chiphuyen) and aspire to become a [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/chiphuyen) influencer. You can also find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pwg2DGwAAAAJ&hl=en). I frequently speak at and occasionally host [events](https://huyenchip.com/events).\n\nI enjoy learning about fun technical challenges and collaborating with great teams.
