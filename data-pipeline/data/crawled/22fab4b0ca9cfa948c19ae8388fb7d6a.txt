# Read the Docs is the _**all-in-one**_ solution for documentation

GitBook is great. However, it lacks many features we consider _essential_ for technical teams. **Read the Docs** is _the_ perfect solution for software documentation. 

Let's compare it to know what you can expect when deploying your project's documentation to Read the Docs.

Create an account Sign up with GitHub or your email. Import your project Select a project from your existing Git repositories. Add YAML config Save this file as `.readthedocs.yaml`, and update the commands as necessary. Your docs build on every commit Like magic.

##  Still not convinced? Try it yourself 

GitBook is a great product, but gives few options because of their **closed source software solution**. For publishing _great documentation_ without vendor lock in and features that your readers will love, Read the Docs is the all-in-one solution that provides everything you need out of the box, from analytics to SSO.
