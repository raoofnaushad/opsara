# LLM-engineer-handbook

[](#llm-engineer-handbook)

🔥 Large Language Models(LLM) have taken the ~~NLP community~~ ~~AI community~~ **the Whole World** by storm.

Why do we create this repo?

  * Everyone can now build an LLM demo in minutes, but it takes a real LLM/AI expert to close the last mile of performance, security, and scalability gaps.
  * The LLM space is complicated! This repo provides a curated list to help you navigate so that you are more likely to build production-grade LLM applications. It includes a collection of Large Language Model frameworks and tutorials, covering model training, serving, fine-tuning, LLM applications & prompt optimization, and LLMOps.



_However, classical ML is not going away. Even LLMs need them. We have seen classical models used for protecting data privacy, detecing hallucinations, and more. So, do not forget to study the fundamentals of classical ML._

## Overview

[](#overview)

The current workflow might look like this: You build a demo using an existing application library or directly from LLM model provider SDKs. It works somehow, but you need to further create evaluation and training datasets to optimize the performance (e.g., accuracy, latency, cost).

You can do prompt engineering or auto-prompt optimization; you can create a larger dataset to fine-tune the LLM or use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the model with human preferences. Then you need to consider the serving and LLMOps to deploy the model at scale and pipelines to refresh the data.

We organize the resources by (1) tracking all libraries, frameworks, and tools, (2) learning resources on the whole LLM lifecycle, (3) understanding LLMs, (4) social accounts and community, and (5) how to contribute to this repo.
