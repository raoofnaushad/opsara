This PR merges the `triton-mlir` branch, in which we have been quietly
rewriting the Triton backend from scratch to increase maintainability,
stability and ultimately performance. Changes to the runtime are
minimal, and this new version aims to remain backward-compatible with
the previous commit. The legacy backend is now officially deprecated,
but can still be accessed via the `legacy-backend` tag.

# Triton

[](#triton)

This is the development repository of Triton, a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep-Learning primitives. The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA, but also with higher flexibility than other existing DSLs.

The foundations of this project are described in the following MAPL2019 publication: [Triton: An Intermediate Language and Compiler for Tiled Neural Network Computations](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~htk/publication/2019-mapl-tillet-kung-cox.pdf). Please consider citing this work if you use Triton!

The [official documentation](https://triton-lang.org) contains installation instructions and tutorials. See also these third-party [Triton puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Triton-Puzzles), which can all be run using the Triton interpreter -- no GPU required.

# Quick Installation

[](#quick-installation)

You can install the latest stable release of Triton from pip:

```
pip install triton
```

Binary wheels are available for CPython 3.9-3.13.

# Enabling Blackwell Support

[](#enabling-blackwell-support)

The main branch now features support for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs using 5th generation tensor cores. To enable this, you will need two additional steps:

  1. Build a pre-release PyTorch from source with CUDA 12.8
  2. Build triton from the latest source



First, to build pytorch you need to have CUDA 12.8 installed locally. If not, follow the [instructions for your platform](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

```
# Clone and checkout pytorch 2.6 release candidate git clone https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch cd pytorch git checkout v2.6.0-rc9 git submodule sync git submodule update --init --recursive -j 8 # Install build dependencies (assumes you already have a system compiler) pip install -r requirements.txt pip install mkl-static mkl-include wheel # Build PyTorch (will take a long time) export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.8 export CUDA_PATH=$CUDA_HOME export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=Blackwell python setup.py develop # Optional, package build into a wheel to install on other machines. python setup.py bdist_wheel ls dist # Wheel should be output in this directory
```

Note that if you use the domain libraries (`torchvision`, `torchtext`, `torchaudio`, etc.) these will need to be built from source as well, otherwise their custom PyTorch extensions will not work.

Finally, follow the instructions below to install triton from source.

# Install from source

[](#install-from-source)

```
git clone https://github.com/triton-lang/triton.git cd triton pip install ninja cmake wheel pybind11 # build-time dependencies pip install -e python
```

Or with a virtualenv:

```
git clone https://github.com/triton-lang/triton.git cd triton python -m venv .venv --prompt triton source .venv/bin/activate pip install ninja cmake wheel pybind11 # build-time dependencies pip install -e python
```

# Building with a custom LLVM

[](#building-with-a-custom-llvm)

Triton uses LLVM to generate code for GPUs and CPUs. Normally, the Triton build downloads a prebuilt LLVM, but you can also build LLVM from source and use that.

LLVM does not have a stable API, so the Triton build will not work at an arbitrary LLVM version.

  1. Find the version of LLVM that Triton builds against. Check `cmake/llvm-hash.txt` to see the current version. For example, if it says: 49af6502c6dcb4a7f7520178bd14df396f78240c

This means that the version of Triton you have builds against [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) 49af6502.

  2. `git checkout` LLVM at this revision. Optionally, make additional modifications to LLVM.

  3. [Build LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html). For example, you might run

```
`$ cd $HOME/llvm-project # your clone of LLVM. $ mkdir build $ cd build $ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON ../llvm -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir;llvm" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host;NVPTX;AMDGPU" $ ninja `
```

  4. Grab a snack, this will take a while.

  5. Build Triton as above, but set the following environment variables.

```
`# Modify as appropriate to point to your LLVM build. $ export LLVM_BUILD_DIR=$HOME/llvm-project/build $ cd <triton install> $ LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS=$LLVM_BUILD_DIR/include \ LLVM_LIBRARY_DIR=$LLVM_BUILD_DIR/lib \ LLVM_SYSPATH=$LLVM_BUILD_DIR \ pip install -e python `
```




# Tips for building

[](#tips-for-building)

  * Set `TRITON_BUILD_WITH_CLANG_LLD=true` as an environment variable to use clang and lld. lld in particular results in faster builds.

  * Set `TRITON_BUILD_WITH_CCACHE=true` to build with ccache.

  * Set `TRITON_HOME=/some/path` to change the location of the `.triton` directory where Triton's cache is located and downloads are stored during the build. By default, this is the user's home directory. It can be changed anytime.

  * Pass `--no-build-isolation` to `pip install` to make nop builds faster. Without this, every invocation of `pip install` uses a different symlink to cmake, and this forces ninja to rebuild most of the `.a` files.

  * vscode intellisense has some difficulty figuring out how to build Triton's C++ (probably because, in our build, users don't invoke cmake directly, but instead use setup.py). Teach vscode how to compile Triton as follows.

    * Do a local build. Run command `pip install -e python`
    * Get the full path to the `compile_commands.json` file produced by the build: `find python/build -name 'compile_commands.json' | xargs readlink -f`. You might get a full path similar to `/Users/{username}/triton/python/build/cmake.macosx-11.1-arm64-cpython-3.12/compile_commands.json`
    * In vscode, install the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools), then open the command palette (`Shift + Command + P` on Mac, or `Shift + Ctrl + P` on Windows/Linux) and open `C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)`.
    * Open "Advanced Settings" and paste the full path to `compile_commands.json` into the "Compile Commands" textbox.



# Running tests

[](#running-tests)

There currently isn't a turnkey way to run all the Triton tests, but you can follow the following recipe.

```
# One-time setup. Note this will reinstall local Triton because torch # overwrites it with the public version. $ make dev-install # To run all tests (requires a GPU) $ make test # Or, to run tests without a gpu $ make test-nogpu
```

# Tips for hacking

[](#tips-for-hacking)

For detailed instructions on how to debug Triton's frontend, please refer to this [tutorial](https://triton-lang.org/main/programming-guide/chapter-3/debugging.html). The following includes additional tips for hacking on Triton's backend.

**Helpful environment variables**

  * `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP=1` dumps the IR before every MLIR pass Triton runs, for all kernels. Use `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP=kernelName` to dump for a specific kernel only.

    * Triton cache can interfere with the dump. In cases where `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP=1` does not work, try cleaning your triton cache: `rm -r ~/.triton/cache/*`
  * `MLIR_DUMP_PATH` specifies where `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP` will dump to. If unset will dump to stderr.

  * `LLVM_IR_ENABLE_DUMP=1` dumps the IR before every pass run over the LLVM IR.

  * `TRITON_REPRODUCER_PATH=<reproducer_path>` will generate an MLIR reproducer file at `<reproducer_path>` before each MLIR compiler stage. If any of the stages fail, `<reproducer_path>` will be a local MLIR reproducer captured right before the failing pass.

  * `TRITON_INTERPRET=1` uses the Triton interpreter instead of running on the GPU. You can insert Python breakpoints in your kernel code!

  * `TRITON_ENABLE_LLVM_DEBUG=1` passes `-debug` to LLVM, printing a lot of debugging information to stdout. If this is too noisy, run with just `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY` instead to limit the output.

An alternative way to reduce output noisiness is running with `LLVM_IR_ENABLE_DUMP=1`, extract the IR before the LLVM pass of interest, and then run LLVM's `opt` standalone, perhaps passing `-debug-only=foo` on the command line.

  * `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY=<comma-separated>` is the equivalent of LLVM's `-debug-only` command-line option. This limits the LLVM debug output to specific pass or component names (which are specified using `#define DEBUG_TYPE` throughout LLVM and Triton) in order to allow the debug output to be less noisy. `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY` allows for one or more comma separated values to be specified (eg `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY="tritongpu-remove-layout-conversions"` or `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY="tritongpu-remove-layout-conversions,regalloc"`).

  * `TRITON_ENABLE_ASAN=1` invokes the LLVM address sanitizer for memory leak and out of bounds access detection. Currently only supported on the AMD backend. This must be run using the ASAN libraries documented [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/llvm-project/en/latest/conceptual/using-gpu-sanitizer.html).

When enabling the address sanitizer it is recommended to disable various memory caching strategies both within the ROCm stack and PyTorch. This will give the address sanitizer the best chance at finding the memory fault where it originates. See this [test](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/third_party/amd/python/test/test_address_sanitizer.py) for more details.

  * `USE_IR_LOC={ttir,ttgir}` reparses the IR such that the location information will be the line number of the IR file with that particular extension, instead of line number of the python file. This can provide a direct mapping from the IR to llir/ptx. When used with performance tools, it can provide a breakdown on IR instructions.

  * `TRITON_PRINT_AUTOTUNING=1` prints out the best autotuning config and total time spent for each kernel after autotuning is complete.

  * `DISABLE_LLVM_OPT` will disable llvm optimizations for make_llir and make_ptx if its value is true when parsing as Bool. Otherwise, it will be parsed as a list of flags to disable llvm optimizations. One usage case is `DISABLE_LLVM_OPT="disable-lsr"` Loop strength reduction is known to cause up to 10% performance changes for certain kernels with register pressure.

  * `TRITON_ALWAYS_COMPILE=1` forces to compile kernels regardless of cache hit.

  * `MLIR_ENABLE_TIMING` dumps the timing information for each MLIR pass.

  * `LLVM_ENABLE_TIMING` dumps the timing information for each LLVM pass.

  * `TRITON_DEFAULT_FP_FUSION` overrides the default behavior of allowing fp fusion (mul+add->fma).

  * `MLIR_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS=<comma-separated>` controls diagnostic emission in MLIR. Options are: `warnings`, `remarks`, `stacktraces`, `operations`. Use comma-separated values to customize output. For example, `MLIR_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS=remarks,operations` enables remarks and IR operations, while `MLIR_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS=warnings,stacktraces` enables warnings with stacktraces. By default, only errors are shown. Setting `warnings` includes errors and warnings; `remarks` includes errors, warnings, and remarks.

  * `MLIR_ENABLE_REMARK` is deprecated. Please use `MLIR_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS=remarks`.

  * `TRITON_KERNEL_DUMP` enables the dumping of the IR from each compilation stage and the final ptx/amdgcn.

  * `TRITON_DUMP_DIR` specifies the directory to save the dumped IR and ptx/amdgcn when `TRITON_KERNEL_DUMP` is set to 1.

  * `TRITON_KERNEL_OVERRIDE` enables the override of the compiled kernel with a user-specified IR/ptx/amdgcn at the beginning of each compilation stage.

  * `TRITON_OVERRIDE_DIR` specifies the directory from which to load the IR/ptx/amdgcn files when `TRITON_KERNEL_OVERRIDE` is set to 1.




**Kernel Override Steps**

```
export TRITON_ALWAYS_COMPILE=1 export TRITON_KERNEL_DUMP=1 export TRITON_DUMP_DIR=<dump_dir> export TRITON_KERNEL_OVERRIDE=1 export TRITON_OVERRIDE_DIR=<override_dir> # Step 1: Run the kernel once to dump kernel's IRs and ptx/amdgcn in $TRITON_DUMP_DIR # Step 2: Copy $TRITON_DUMP_DIR/<kernel_hash> to $TRITON_OVERRIDE_DIR # Step 3: Delete the stages that you do not want to override and modify the stage you do want to override # Step 4: Run the kernel again to see the overridden result
```
