Both assistants used a format that accurately represents the relationships present in the sentence with minor differences in the stylistic representation of the predicate. Assistant 1 used the natural language format for predicates, stating \"has ground\" and \"plays at\", which clearly aligns with the typical RDF representation where the predicate tries to be a URI that is more formal. However, since the task prompt doesn't specify a requirement for the predicates to be in URI form, this representation is acceptable, especially considering human readability. Assistant 2 transformed the predicates into a more formal-looking format by using camel case (hasGround, playsAt), which may suggest a transition towards a URI, although they are not provided as such. This is a common practice when designing RDF predicates, intending to align with web standards, although again, the task did not explicitly require this form. Both assistants explained the relationships captured by the triplets, which is helpful for understanding how the RDF structure relates to the original sentence. There are no factual inaccuracies in either output, and both sets of triplets are equivalent in terms of the information they represent. Overall, the level of detail was similar, with each assistant providing a brief explanation following their respective triplets. Neither output contained unnecessary or irrelevant information, and no critical information was missing. Both assistants would have received a score of 10 if the predicates were provided in a format that hinted at being URIs (e.g., prefixed with a namespace or in a full URI format), which is the more standard and formal practice for RDF predicates. Nevertheless, the assistants' performance was high given the context of the question, which did not specify this requirement.

They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the Constitution of Australia came into force, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.\"? Answer:|  Certainly! Here's a detailed and long answer to the question you provided: Question: Read the passage below and answer the following questions. Passage: In 1901, the Federation of Australia was the process by which the six separate British self-governing colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia formed one nation. They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the Constitution of Australia came into force, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia. 1. What event did the passage describe? 2. How many colonies were involved in the Federation of Australia? 3. What did the colonies keep after forming one nation? 4. What was the purpose of the federal government established by the Constitution of Australia? 5. What were the colonies called after they became states of the Commonwealth of Australia? Answers: 1. The passage describes the Federation of Australia, which was the process by which six separate British self-governing colonies formed one nation. 2. Six colonies were involved in the Federation of Australia: New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia. 3. The colonies kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies. 4. The federal government established by the Constitution of Australia was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. 5. After becoming states of the Commonwealth of Australia, the colonies were called states. In-depth analysis: The passage provides a brief overview of the Federation of Australia, which was the process by which six separate British self-governing colonies formed one nation in 1901. The colonies kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies, but they also established a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. This federal government was established by the Constitution of Australia, which came into force on January 1, 1901. The passage highlights the significance of the Federation of Australia by noting that it was a process by which the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia. This transformation marked a significant milestone in the history of Australia, as it created a unified nation out of six separate colonies. The passage also provides information about the systems of government that were kept by the colonies after forming one nation. Specifically, it notes that the colonies kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies. This suggests that the Federation of Australia did not result in a complete overhaul of the existing systems of government, but rather a reorganization of these systems to create a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. Finally, the passage uses descriptive language to emphasize the importance of the Constitution of Australia in the Federation of Australia. It notes that the Constitution came into force on January 1, 1901, and that it established the federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. This language emphasizes the significance of the Constitution in the formation of the Federation of Australia and the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia. In conclusion, the passage provides a detailed overview of the Federation of Australia, highlighting the significance of the Constitution of Australia in the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia. It also provides information about the systems of government that were kept by the colonies after forming one nation, and emphasizes the importance of the Constitution in the creation of the federal government responsible for matters concerning the whole nation.| Based on the passage, discuss the primary motivations and outcomes of the 1901 Federation of Australia, including the roles and responsibilities of the federal government, as well as the continued governmental structures of the individual states involved.| [ \"Based on the passage, discuss the primary motivations and outcomes of the 1901 Federation of Australia, including the roles and responsibilities of the federal government, as well as the continued governmental structures of the individual states involved.\", \" Certainly!

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.| What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? One of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses. There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous. These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down. Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD. Summary:| Involuntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses.|  One of the primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of various parts of the body, such as the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. This tremor is often worse when the affected person is at rest and can progress to more pronounced tremors when the person is using their hands and arms. Parkinson's disease is one of the most common causes of tremors, and it often presents as the first symptom of the disease. Other symptoms of Parkinson's include slowed movements, balance problems, and distortions in voluntary movements, as well as potential cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression.

These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \\\"festinating gait,\\\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down. Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\n\\n[The Start of Assistant 1's Answer>\\nInvoluntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses.\\n[The End of Assistant 1's Answer>\\n[The Start of Assistant 2's Answer>\\n One of the primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of various parts of the body, such as the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face.

For example, they produce a hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when more are needed. They also secrete a hormone that regulates blood pressure and keeps it in a normal range. Q: What organs secrete hormones that help maintain homeostasis? A: The answer is:| The kidneys are the organs that secrete hormones to help maintain homeostasis. They produce a hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when needed, and they also secrete a hormone that regulates blood pressure, keeping it within a normal range.|  Certainly! Based on the provided paragraph, the organs that secrete hormones to help maintain homeostasis are the kidneys. The kidneys produce two hormones that help regulate various physiological processes in the body: 1. Erythropoietin (EPO): This hormone stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells when there is a decrease in the number of red blood cells in the body. This helps to maintain normal red blood cell levels and prevent anemia. 2. Renin: This hormone regulates blood pressure by controlling the amount of fluid in the body and the diameter of blood vessels. When blood pressure is low, the kidneys produce more renin, which causes the blood vessels to constrict and retain more fluid. This helps to increase blood pressure back to normal levels. So, to summarize, the organs that secrete hormones to help maintain homeostasis are the kidneys, specifically the nephrons within the kidneys. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, such as red blood cell production and blood pressure, to maintain homeostasis in the body.| [ \" Certainly!

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \"No I can't\". Question: What is Tool's relation to Ross. Movie title: The Expendables Movie plot: The movie is a Vietnam exploitation film where a commando makes an elite team out of rebels. The men are trouble makers and rebels, but are able to perform well. The men are sent out to blow up a bridge and manage to destroy the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) guards. However, another NVA force arrives and an all out battle commences. During the battle, two of the men are killed, but the team kills off all of the NVA reinforcements and captures their leader. The team is next sent on another mission to capture two village women, and then another to destroy an enemy base where another member is killed. They kill all of the NVA forces in the base, but their mission gets tougher when a prisoner escapes and captures American women and holds them hostage. The NVA splits up into two forces: one at an old fort and the other to ambush the team as it arrives. Despite the NVA plan of ambush, the NVA are wiped out, but they manage to kill two of the women and one of the special squad. Realizing that there is little time, the squad goes on with their mission and finds the fort. Their squad leader goes inside the fort to recon and is captured. The squad decides to go in and rescue him, the POW girls, and kill the NVA leader. The answer is:|  Yes, I can help you answer a few questions about the film proposal. Based on the information provided, here are my thoughts: 1. Marketability: The film's genre, a Vietnam exploitation film, may have limited appeal to a broad audience. However, the inclusion of action-packed sequences, rebels, and a captivating storyline could attract fans of the action and adventure genre. 2. Originality: The film's plot, with its mix of action, adventure, and exploitation elements, may not be entirely original. However, the unique twist of having a commando make an elite team out of rebels could add a fresh spin to the genre. 3. Production feasibility: The film's setting, a Vietnamese jungle, could present some challenges in terms of production logistics and budget. However, with careful planning and execution, it is possible to create a visually stunning and immersive environment. 4.

Movie title: The Expendables Movie plot: The movie is a Vietnam exploitation film where a commando makes an elite team out of rebels. The men are trouble makers and rebels, but are able to perform well. The men are sent out to blow up a bridge and manage to destroy the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) guards. However, another NVA force arrives and an all out battle commences. During the battle, two of the men are killed, but the team kills off all of the NVA reinforcements and captures their leader. The team is next sent on another mission to capture two village women, and then another to destroy an enemy base where another member is killed. They kill all of the NVA forces in the base, but their mission gets tougher when a prisoner escapes and captures American women and holds them hostage. The NVA splits up into two forces: one at an old fort and the other to ambush the team as it arrives. Despite the NVA plan of ambush, the NVA are wiped out, but they manage to kill two of the women and one of the special squad. Realizing that there is little time, the squad goes on with their mission and finds the fort. Their squad leader goes inside the fort to recon and is captured. The squad decides to go in and rescue him, the POW girls, and kill the NVA leader.\\nThe answer is:\\n\\n\\n[The Start of Assistant 1's Answer>\\nTool is a character in The Expendables movie and is played by actor Mickey Rourke.

The original dataset has been used by 100s of open-source practitioners and models. We knew from fixing UltraFeedback (and before that, Alpacas and Dollys) that this dataset could be highly improved.\n\nContinuing with our mission to build the best alignment datasets for open-source LLMs and the community, we spent a few hours improving it with [distilabel](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel). \n\nThis was our main intuition: the original dataset just assumes gpt4/3.5-turbo are always the best response. We know from UltraFeedback that's not always the case. Moreover, DPO fine-tuning benefits from the diversity of preference pairs. \n\nAdditionally, we have added a new column indicating whether the question in the dataset is part of the train set of gsm8k (there were no examples from the test set). See the reproduction section for more details.\n\n##  [ ](#using-this-dataset) Using this dataset \n\nThis dataset is useful for preference tuning and we recommend using it instead of the original. It's already prepared in the \"standard\" chosen, rejected format with additional information for further filtering and experimentation. \n\nThe main changes are:\n\n  1. ~2K pairs have been swapped: rejected become the chosen response. We have kept the original chosen and rejected on two new columns `original_*` for reproducibility purposes.\n  2. 4K pairs have been identified as `tie`: equally bad or good.\n  3. Chosen scores have been added: you can now filter out based on a threshold (see our distilabeled Hermes 2.5 model for an example)\n  4. We have kept the ratings and rationales generated with gpt-4-turbo and distilabel so you can prepare the data differently if you want.\n  5. We have added a column to indicate if the input is part of gsm8k train set.\n\n\n\nIn our experiments, we have got very good results by reducing the size of the dataset by more than 50%. Here's an example of how to achieve that:\n\n```\n`from datasets import load_dataset # Instead of this: # dataset = load_dataset(\"Intel/orca_dpo_pairs\", split=\"train\") # use this: dataset = load_dataset(\"argilla/distilabel-intel-orca-dpo-pairs\", split=\"train\") dataset = dataset.filter( lambda r: r[\"status\"] != \"tie\" and r[\"chosen_score\"] >= 8 and not r[\"in_gsm8k_train\"] ) `\n```\n\nThis results in `5,922` instead of `12,859` samples (54% reduction) and leads to better performance than the same model tuned with 100% of the samples in the original dataset.\n\n> We'd love to hear about your experiments! If you want to try this out, consider joining our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/rubrixworkspace/shared_invite/zt-whigkyjn-a3IUJLD7gDbTZ0rKlvcJ5g) and let's build some open datasets and models together.\n\n##  [ ](#reproducing-the-dataset) Reproducing the dataset \n\nIn this section, we outline the steps to reproduce this dataset.\n\n###  [ ](#rate-original-dataset-pairs) Rate original dataset pairs \n\nBuild a preference dataset with distilabel using the original dataset:\n\n```\n`from distilabel.llm import OpenAILLM from distilabel.tasks import JudgeLMTask from distilabel.pipeline import Pipeline from datasets import load_dataset # Shuffle 'chosen' and 'rejected' to avoid positional bias and keep track of the order def shuffle_and_track(chosen, rejected): pair = [chosen, rejected] random.shuffle(pair) order = [\"chosen\" if x == chosen else \"rejected\" for x in pair] return {\"generations\": pair, \"order\": order} dataset = load_dataset(\"Intel/orca_dpo_pairs\", split=\"train\") # This shuffles the pairs to mitigate positional bias dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: shuffle_and_track(x[\"chosen\"], x[\"rejected\"])) # We use our JudgeLM implementation to rate the original pairs labeler = OpenAILLM( task=JudgeLMTask(), model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\", num_threads=16, max_new_tokens=512, ) dataset = dataset.rename_columns({\"question\": \"input\"}) distipipe = Pipeline( labeller=labeler ) # This computes ratings and natural language critiques for each pair ds = distipipe.generate(dataset=dataset, num_generations=2) `\n```\n\nIf you want to further filter and curate the dataset, you can push the dataset to [Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla) as follows:\n\n```\n`rg_dataset = ds.to_argilla() rg_dataset.push_to_argilla(name=\"your_dataset_name\", workspace=\"your_workspace_name\") `\n```\n\nYou get a nice UI with a lot of pre-computed metadata to explore and curate the dataset:\n\n[![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/60420dccc15e823a685f2b03/IoK4nFObadhJpkVmWALZP.png)](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/60420dccc15e823a685f2b03/IoK4nFObadhJpkVmWALZP.png)\n\nThe resulting dataset is now much more useful: we know which response is preferred (by gpt-4-turbo), which ones have low scores, and we even have natural language explanations. But what did we find? Was our intuition confirmed?\n\n[![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/60420dccc15e823a685f2b03/-V8wY1DYzrtwM9LbGrBXq.png)](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/60420dccc15e823a685f2b03/-V8wY1DYzrtwM9LbGrBXq.png)\n\nThe above chart shows the following: \n\n  * ~4,000 pairs were given the same rating (a tie).\n  * ~7,000 pairs were correct according to our AI judge (`unchanged`).\n  * and ~2,000 times the rejected response was preferred (`swapped`).\n\n\n\nNow the next question is: can we build better models with this new knowledge? The answer is the \"distilabeled Hermes\" model, check it out!\n\n###  [ ](#post-processing-to-add-useful-information) Post-processing to add useful information \n\nSwap rejected and chosen, and add chosen scores and status:\n\n```\n`def add_status(r): status = \"unchanged\" highest_rated_idx = np.argmax(r['rating']) # Compare to the index of the chosen response if r['rating']== None or r['rating'][0] == r['rating'][1]: status = \"tie\" elif r['order'][highest_rated_idx] != 'chosen': status = \"swapped\" return {\"status\": status} def swap(r): chosen = r[\"chosen\"] rejected = r[\"rejected\"] if r['rating'] is not None: chosen_score = r['rating'][np.argmax(r['rating'])] else: chosen_score = None if r['status'] == \"swapped\": chosen = r[\"rejected\"] rejected = r[\"chosen\"] return { \"chosen\": chosen, \"rejected\": rejected, \"original_chosen\": r[\"chosen\"], \"original_rejected\": r[\"rejected\"], \"chosen_score\": chosen_score } updated = ds.map(add_status).map(swap) `\n```\n\n###  [ ](#gsm8k-decontamination) gsm8k \"decontamination\" \n\nThe basic approach for finding duplicated examples.
