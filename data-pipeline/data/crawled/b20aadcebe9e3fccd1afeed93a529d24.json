Turn documents into usable data and shift your focus to acting on information rather than compiling it. Start with prebuilt models or create custom models tailored to your documents both on premises and in the cloud with the [AI Document Intelligence studio](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217476) or [SDK](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217261).\n\n![](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/maps-data-service?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=48&hei=48&qlt=75&fit=constrain)\n\n##  Simple text extraction \n\nEasily pull data and organize information with prebuilt and custom features—no manual labeling required.\n\n![](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/results?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=48&hei=48&qlt=75&fit=constrain)\n\n##  Customized results \n\nGet output tailored to your layouts with automatic custom extraction and improve it with human feedback.\n\n![](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/flexible?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=48&hei=48&qlt=75&fit=constrain)\n\n##  Flexible deployment \n\nIngest data from the cloud or at the edge and apply to search indexes, business automation workflows, and more.\n\n![](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/unlock-check?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=48&hei=48&qlt=75&fit=constrain)\n\n##  Built-in security \n\nRely on enterprise-grade security and privacy applied to both your data and any trained models.\n\n[ Check out what's new with Azure AI at Build ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2214825&clcid=0x809)\n\n##  Use AI to Build Document Processing Workflows \n\nLearn how to accelerate your business processes by automating text extraction with AI Document Intelligence.

The custom extraction capabilities in AI Document Intelligence help you overcome this challenge by training on your own data based on just five documents. Not only is the first output more reliable and tailored to your needs, but it also allows you to provide human input to create a highly accurate model customized to your forms.\n\n##  Apply AI Document Intelligence anywhere, in the cloud or at the edge \n\nRecognize forms at the edge, on-premises, and in the cloud with container support in Azure AI Services. The portable architecture can be deployed directly to [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217266) or [Azure Container Instances](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217607), or to a [Kubernetes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217481) cluster deployed to [Azure Stack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217356).
