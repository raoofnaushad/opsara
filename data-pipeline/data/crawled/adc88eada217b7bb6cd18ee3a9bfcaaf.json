As such, it is able to output coherent text in 46 languages and 13 programming languages that is hardly distinguishable from text written by humans. BLOOM can also be instructed to perform text tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained for, by casting them as text generation tasks.\n\n##  [ ](#basics) Basics \n\n_This section provides information about the model type, version, license, funders, release date, developers, and contact information._ _It is useful for anyone who wants to reference the model._\n\nClick to expand\n\n**Developed by:** BigScience ([website](https://bigscience.huggingface.co))\n\n_All collaborators are either volunteers or have an agreement with their employer.
