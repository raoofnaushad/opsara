We [support popular text models](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/). Please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/issues/new) if you want us to add a new model.\n\nThe default text embedding (`TextEmbedding`) model is Flag Embedding, presented in the [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) leaderboard. It supports \"query\" and \"passage\" prefixes for the input text. Here is an example for [Retrieval Embedding Generation](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/qdrant/Retrieval_with_FastEmbed/) and how to use [FastEmbed with Qdrant](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/qdrant/Usage_With_Qdrant/).\n\n## 📈 Why FastEmbed?\n\n[](#-why-fastembed)\n\n  1. Light: FastEmbed is a lightweight library with few external dependencies. We don't require a GPU and don't download GBs of PyTorch dependencies, and instead use the ONNX Runtime. This makes it a great candidate for serverless runtimes like AWS Lambda.\n\n  2. Fast: FastEmbed is designed for speed. We use the ONNX Runtime, which is faster than PyTorch. We also use data parallelism for encoding large datasets.\n\n  3. Accurate: FastEmbed is better than OpenAI Ada-002. We also [support](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/) an ever-expanding set of models, including a few multilingual models.\n\n\n\n\n## 🚀 Installation\n\n[](#-installation)\n\nTo install the FastEmbed library, pip works best. You can install it with or without GPU support:\n\n```\npip install fastembed # or with GPU support pip install fastembed-gpu\n```\n\n## 📖 Quickstart\n\n[](#-quickstart)\n\n```\nfrom fastembed import TextEmbedding # Example list of documents documents: list[str] = [ \"This is built to be faster and lighter than other embedding libraries e.g. Transformers, Sentence-Transformers, etc.\", \"fastembed is supported by and maintained by Qdrant.\", ] # This will trigger the model download and initialization embedding_model = TextEmbedding() print(\"The model BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 is ready to use.\") embeddings_generator = embedding_model.embed(documents) # reminder this is a generator embeddings_list = list(embedding_model.embed(documents)) # you can also convert the generator to a list, and that to a numpy array len(embeddings_list[0]) # Vector of 384 dimensions\n```\n\nFastembed supports a variety of models for different tasks and modalities. The list of all the available models can be found [here](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/)\n\n### 🎒 Dense text embeddings\n\n[](#-dense-text-embeddings)\n\n```\nfrom fastembed import TextEmbedding model = TextEmbedding(model_name=\"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\") embeddings = list(model.embed(documents)) # [ # array([-0.1115, 0.0097, 0.0052, 0.0195, ...], dtype=float32), # array([-0.1019, 0.0635, -0.0332, 0.0522, ...], dtype=float32) # ]\n```\n\n### 🔱 Sparse text embeddings\n\n[](#-sparse-text-embeddings)\n\n  * SPLADE++\n\n\n\n```\nfrom fastembed import SparseTextEmbedding model = SparseTextEmbedding(model_name=\"prithivida/Splade_PP_en_v1\") embeddings = list(model.embed(documents)) # [ # SparseEmbedding(indices=[ 17, 123, 919, ... ], values=[0.71, 0.22, 0.39, ...]), # SparseEmbedding(indices=[ 38, 12, 91, ... ], values=[0.11, 0.22, 0.39, ...]) # ]\n```\n\n### 🦥 Late interaction models (aka ColBERT)\n\n[](#-late-interaction-models-aka-colbert)\n\n```\nfrom fastembed import LateInteractionTextEmbedding model = LateInteractionTextEmbedding(model_name=\"colbert-ir/colbertv2.0\") embeddings = list(model.embed(documents)) # [ # array([ # [-0.1115, 0.0097, 0.0052, 0.0195, ...], # [-0.1019, 0.0635, -0.0332, 0.0522, ...], # ]), # array([ # [-0.9019, 0.0335, -0.0032, 0.0991, ...], # [-0.2115, 0.8097, 0.1052, 0.0195, ...], # ]),  # ]\n```\n\n### 🖼️ Image embeddings\n\n[](#️-image-embeddings)\n\n```\nfrom fastembed import ImageEmbedding images = [ \"./path/to/image1.jpg\", \"./path/to/image2.jpg\", ] model = ImageEmbedding(model_name=\"Qdrant/clip-ViT-B-32-vision\") embeddings = list(model.embed(images)) # [ # array([-0.1115, 0.0097, 0.0052, 0.0195, ...], dtype=float32), # array([-0.1019, 0.0635, -0.0332, 0.0522, ...], dtype=float32) # ]\n```\n\n### 🔄 Rerankers\n\n[](#-rerankers)\n\n```\nfrom fastembed.rerank.cross_encoder import TextCrossEncoder query = \"Who is maintaining Qdrant?\" documents: list[str] = [ \"This is built to be faster and lighter than other embedding libraries e.g. Transformers, Sentence-Transformers, etc.\", \"fastembed is supported by and maintained by Qdrant.\", ] encoder = TextCrossEncoder(model_name=\"Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2\") scores = list(encoder.rerank(query, documents)) # [-11.48061752319336, 5.472434997558594]\n```\n\n## ⚡️ FastEmbed on a GPU\n\n[](#️-fastembed-on-a-gpu)\n\nFastEmbed supports running on GPU devices. It requires installation of the `fastembed-gpu` package.\n\n```\npip install fastembed-gpu\n```\n\nCheck our [example](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/FastEmbed_GPU/) for detailed instructions, CUDA 12.x support and troubleshooting of the common issues.\n\n```\nfrom fastembed import TextEmbedding embedding_model = TextEmbedding( model_name=\"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\", providers=[\"CUDAExecutionProvider\"] ) print(\"The model BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 is ready to use on a GPU.\")\n```\n\n## Usage with Qdrant\n\n[](#usage-with-qdrant)\n\nInstallation with Qdrant Client in Python:\n\n```\npip install qdrant-client[fastembed]\n```\n\nor\n\n```\npip install qdrant-client[fastembed-gpu]\n```\n\nYou might have to use quotes `pip install 'qdrant-client[fastembed]'` on zsh.\n\n```\nfrom qdrant_client import QdrantClient #
