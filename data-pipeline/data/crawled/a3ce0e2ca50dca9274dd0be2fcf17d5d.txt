🎮 Welcome to AlignEval! 🎮

AlignEval is a **game/tool** to help you build and optimize LLM-evaluators. We do so by aligning annotators to AI output, and aligning AI to annotator input.

To progress, gain XP by adding labels while you **look at your data**.

  1. **🐣 Upload:** Initialize your character by uploading a csv containing input-output pairs. Having existing labels counts towards your XP!
  2. **👀 Label:** As a **Labeling Novice** , **look at your data and label it**. Each labeled sample gets you 1 XP. Gain 20 XP to progress to the next character class!
  3. **💥 Evaluate:** At 20 XP, you're now an **Evaluation Adept**! You can now craft evaluation prompts and cast the **"Evaluate"** spell on your data.
  4. **🔮 Optimize:** At 50 XP, you're now an **Optimization Master**! Improve your LLM-evaluators with the unlocked **"Optimize"** spell. (No, it's not dspy.)



**New Game+:** While we frame AlignEval as a game to build LLM-evaluators, you can use it to craft and optimize **any prompt that does binary classification**!

AlignEval is currently a public beta. Read [how it was built](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/aligneval/) or share feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/eugeneyan/align-app) or [X](https://x.com/eugeneyan).

## 🎮 To begin, initialize your character with a CSV file!

  * 📜 The CSV file must include the following columns:
    * **`id`** : Unique identifier for each row
    * **`input`** : Context used to generate `output`
    * **`output`** : Generated text to be evaluated
    * **`label`** : Ground truth (values optional but counts towards XP)
  * 🚨 The **`label`** column only accepts binary labels, either **`0`** or **`1`**.
    * **`0`** : Output **PASSES** your evaluation
    * **`1`** : Output **FAILS** your evaluation
  * 🚫 **Character XP limit** : Only the first 100 rows will be uploaded and considered for XP.
  * 🎁 **Starter pack** : [Download a partially labeled CSV](#) from the Factual Inconsistency Benchmark ([details](https://huggingface.co/datasets/r-three/fib)).
  * 📌 **Pro tip** : For maximum effectiveness on "Evaluate" and "Optimize", have a balance of **`1`** and **`0`** labels.
