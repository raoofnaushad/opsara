, **compute (GPUs)** and **community** to learn everything in one day. \n\nLearn more\n\nWhile the specific task in this course involves fine-tuning an LLM for a supervised task, everything we learn **easily extends** to all applications (NLP, CV, time-series, etc.), models (regression → LLMs), data modalities (tabular, text, etc.), cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) and scale (local laptop → distributed cluster). \n\nFirst principles \n\nBefore we jump straight into the code, we develop a first principles understanding for every machine learning concept. \n\nBest practices \n\nImplement software engineering best practices as we develop and deploy our machine learning models. \n\nScale \n\nEasily scale ML workloads (data, train, tune, serve) in Python without having to learn completely new languages. \n\nMLOps \n\nConnect MLOps components (tracking, testing, serving, orchestration, etc.) as we build an end-to-end machine learning system. \n\nDev to Prod \n\nLearn how to quickly and reliably go from development to production without any changes to our code or infra management. \n\nCI/CD \n\nLearn how to create mature CI/CD workflows to continuously train and deploy better models in a modular way that integrates with any stack. \n\n## Who is this content for?\n\nMachine learning is not a separate industry, instead, it's a powerful way of thinking about data that's not reserved for any one type of person.\n\n👩‍💻 All developers \n\nWhether software/infra engineer or data scientist, ML is increasingly becoming a key part of the products that you'll be developing. \n\n👩‍🎓 College graduates \n\nLearn the practical skills required for industry and bridge gap between the university curriculum and what industry expects. \n\n👩‍💼 Product/Leadership \n\nwho want to develop a technical foundation so that they can build amazing (and reliable) products powered by machine learning. \n\n## Meet your instructor\n\n![Goku Mohandas](/static/images/goku_circle.png)\n\n### Hi, I'm Goku Mohandas\n\n[](https://twitter.com/GokuMohandas) [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goku) [](https://www.github.com/GokuMohandas) [](https://www.youtube.com/c/MadeWithML)\n\nI've spent [my career](https://linkedin.com/in/goku) developing ML applications across all scales and industries. Specifically over the last four years (through Made With ML), I’ve had the opportunity to help dozens of F500 companies + startups build out their ML platforms and launch high-impact ML applications on top of them. I started Made With ML to address the gaps in education and share the best practices on how to deliver value with ML in production. \n\nWhile this was an amazing experience, it was also a humbling one because there were obstacles around **scale** , **integrations** and **productionization** that I didn’t have great solutions for. So, I decided to join a team that has been addressing these precise obstacles with some of the [best ML teams](https://www.anyscale.com/user-stories) in the world and has an even bigger vision I could stand behind. So I'm excited to announce that Made With ML is now part of [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/) to accelerate the path towards production ML. \n\n🎉 Made With ML is now part of [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/), read more about it **[here](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/machine-learning-for-developers)**! \n\n## ❤️ Wall of Love\n\nSee what the community has to say about Made With ML.\n\n![profile](/static/images/testimonials/sherry_wang.jpeg)\n\n**Sherry Wang** [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/arghyadeep-das_made-with-ml-activity-6815267985788342272-yJ8e)\n\nSenior ML Engineer - Cars.com\n\n\"Made with ML is one of the best courses I’ve ever taken.

It's a major advantage to understand the fundamentals of this field at this nascent stage so you can responsibly design, develop, deploy and iterate on production ML applications as a foundational developer in your respective industry. \n\n##### What is the time commitment?\n\nYou can go through the lessons at your pace or [sign up](https://4190urw86oh.typeform.com/madewithml) for our upcoming live cohort where we'll provide live lessons, QA, compute (GPUs) and community to learn everything in one day. \n\n##### What happens after the course?\n\nAfter the course, you'll have access to our private community where you can connect with alumni and meet future cohort members as well. You can continue to ask questions about the topics (especially as new tools enter the market), get feedback on your work, etc. \n\n##### Is this course fully remote?\n\nWhen you sign up for the course, you'll have the choice of attending remotely or at one of our in-person weekend sessions near you. \n\nIf you have additional questions, send us an email and we'll get back to you very soon. \n\nTo cite this content, please use:\n\n```\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n```| ```\n`@article{madewithml, author={Goku Mohandas}, title={ Home - Made With ML }, howpublished={\\url{https://madewithml.com/}}, year={2023} } `\n```  \n---|---  \n  \n© 2023 Anyscale, Inc.
