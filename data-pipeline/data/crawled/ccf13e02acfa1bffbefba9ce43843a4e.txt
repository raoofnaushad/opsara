Databricks Unity Catalog is the industry’s only unified and open governance solution for data and AI, built into the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. With Unity Catalog, organizations can seamlessly govern both structured and unstructured data in any format, as well as machine learning models, notebooks, dashboards and files across any cloud or platform. Data scientists, analysts and engineers can securely discover, access and collaborate on trusted data and AI assets across platforms, leveraging AI to boost productivity and unlock the full potential of the lakehouse environment. This unified and open approach to governance promotes interoperability and accelerates data and AI initiatives while simplifying regulatory compliance.

### “Databricks Unity Catalog is now an integral part of the PepsiCo Data Foundation, our centralized global system that consolidates over 6 petabytes of data worldwide. It streamlines the onboarding process for more than 1,500 active users and enables unified data discovery for our 30+ digital product teams across the globe, supporting both business intelligence and artificial intelligence applications.”
