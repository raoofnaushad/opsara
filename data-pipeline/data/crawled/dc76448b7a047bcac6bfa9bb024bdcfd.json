Learning Fundamentals\n\nDeep Learning Fundamentals is a free course on learning deep learning using a modern open-source stack.\n\nIf you found this page, you probably heard that artificial intelligence and deep learning are taking the world by storm. This is correct. In this course, [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/), a best-selling author and professor, will teach you deep learning (machine learning with deep learning) from the ground up via a course of 10 units with bite-sized videos, quizzes, and exercises. The entire course is free and uses the most popular open-source tools for deep learning.\n\n**What will you learn in this course?**\n\n  * What machine learning is and when to use it\n  * The main concepts of deep learning\n  * How to design deep learning experiments with PyTorch\n  * How to write efficient deep learning code with PyTorch Lightning\n\n\n\n**What will you be able to do after this course?**\n\n  * Build classifiers for various kinds of data like tables, images, and text\n  * Tune models effectively to optimize predictive and computational performance\n\n\n\n**How is this course structured?**\n\n  * The course consists of 10 units, each containing several subsections\n  * It is centered around informative, succinct videos that are respectful of your time\n  * In each unit, you will find optional exercises to practice your knowledge\n  * We also provide additional resources for those who want a deep dive on specific topics\n\n\n\n**What are the prerequisites?**\n\n  * Ideally, you should already be familiar with programming in Python\n  * (Some lectures will involve a tiny bit of math, but a strong math background is not required!)\n\n\n\n**Are there interactive quizzes or exercises?**\n\n  * Each section is accompanied by optional multiple-choice quizzes to test your understanding of the material\n  * Optionally, each unit also features one or more code exercises to practice implementing concepts covered in this class\n\n\n\n**Is there a course completion badge or certificate?**\n\n  * At the end of this course, you can take an optional exam featuring 25 multiple-choice questions\n  * Upon answering 80% of the questions in the exam correctly (there are 5 attempts), you obtain an optional course completion badge that can be shared on LinkedIn\n\n[Start Course](https://lightning.ai/pages/courses/deep-learning-fundamentals/unit-1/unit-1-1/)\n\n**Log in or create a free Lightning.ai account to access:**\n\n  * Quizzes\n  * Completion badges\n  * Progress tracking\n  * Additional downloadable content\n  * Additional AI education resources\n  * Notifications when new units are released\n  * Free cloud computing credits\n\n[Sign Up or Log In](https://lightning.ai/sign-in?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Flightning.ai%2Fcourses%2Fdeep-learning-fundamentals%2F)\n\n#####  Watch Video 1\n\n##### Videos\n",
