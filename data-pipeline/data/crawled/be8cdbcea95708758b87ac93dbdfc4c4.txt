In this post, we show you how Amazon Web Services (AWS) helps in solving forecasting challenges by customizing machine learning (ML) models for forecasting. We dive into Amazon SageMaker Canvas and explain how SageMaker Canvas can solve forecasting challenges for retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) enterprises.

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. In this post, I’ll show you how to use Amazon Bedrock—with its fully managed, on-demand API—with your Amazon SageMaker trained or fine-tuned model.

In this blog post, we showcase how you can perform efficient supervised fine tuning for a Meta Llama 3 model using PEFT on AWS Trainium with SageMaker HyperPod. We use HuggingFace’s Optimum-Neuron software development kit (SDK) to apply LoRA to fine-tuning jobs, and use SageMaker HyperPod as the primary compute cluster to perform distributed training on Trainium. Using LoRA supervised fine-tuning for Meta Llama 3 models, you can further reduce your cost to fine tune models by up to 50% and reduce the training time by 70%.

Ensemble models are becoming popular within the ML communities. They generate more accurate predictions through combining the predictions of multiple models. Pipelines can quickly be used to create and end-to-end ML pipeline for ensemble models. This enables developers to build highly accurate models while maintaining efficiency, and reproducibility. In this post, we provide an example of an ensemble model that was trained and deployed using Pipelines.

In this post, we explore a solution for implementing load balancing across login nodes in Slurm-based HyperPod clusters. By distributing user activity evenly across all available nodes, this approach provides more consistent performance, better resource utilization, and a smoother experience for all users. We guide you through the setup process, providing practical steps to achieve effective load balancing in your HyperPod clusters.
