##  Quickly extract text and structure from documents 

AI Document Intelligence is an AI service that applies advanced machine learning to extract text, key-value pairs, tables, and structures from documents automatically and accurately. Turn documents into usable data and shift your focus to acting on information rather than compiling it. Start with prebuilt models or create custom models tailored to your documents both on premises and in the cloud with the [AI Document Intelligence studio](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217476) or [SDK](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217261).

##  Customize text extraction to your forms 

When you're working with documents that deviate from traditional formats, like industry-specific materials, you often need to build your own solution. The custom extraction capabilities in AI Document Intelligence help you overcome this challenge by training on your own data based on just five documents. Not only is the first output more reliable and tailored to your needs, but it also allows you to provide human input to create a highly accurate model customized to your forms.

##  Apply AI Document Intelligence anywhere, in the cloud or at the edge 

Recognize forms at the edge, on-premises, and in the cloud with container support in Azure AI Services. The portable architecture can be deployed directly to [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217266) or [Azure Container Instances](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217607), or to a [Kubernetes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217481) cluster deployed to [Azure Stack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2217356). Use the REST interface of the AI Document Intelligence API to then integrate into Azure Applied AI search indexes, automate business processes, and create custom workflows for your business.
