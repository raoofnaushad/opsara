We are aware that\nright now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if\nthe eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep\nin mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,\nwe will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing\nthe task.\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval\nperformance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able\nto see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum\neval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and\ncontribute evals.**\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON\nfiles, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before\nsubmitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available\n\\[here\\]\\(https://git-lfs.com\\).\n## Eval details 📑\n### Eval name\nself_prompting\n### Eval description\nIn the Self-Prompting eval, models \\(Prompters\\) write prompts for other\nmodels \\(Taskers\\) to perform various tasks. The effectiveness of the\nPrompters are measured in terms of the accuracy of downstream Taskers on\nthe tasks \\(which are other evals from this repository\\).\n### What makes this a useful eval?\nWe want to closely monitor when AI systems may reach human-level or\nbeyond in AI R&D. In LLM R&D, key avenues for augmenting an existing LM\ninclude fine-tuning, prompting, and external tooling. This eval focuses\non prompting: How well can LMs write prompts for themselves to perform\nvarious tasks? \\(This is also relevant for LLMs being able to deploy\ncopies of themselves.\\)\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,\nwe are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite\nbeing capable of generating a good response \\(note that there are some\nthings large language models cannot do, so those would not make good\nevals\\).\nYour eval should be:\n- \\[x\\] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically\nconsistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some\nparticular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases\nwhere the model fails to reason about the physical world.\n- \\[x\\] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4\nor GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\n- \\[x\\] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means\neither a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded\neval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`\nModel-graded eval.\n- \\[x\\] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please\ndocument it below.\n### Unique eval value\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.\n\\(Not required\\)\n## Eval structure 🏗️\nYour eval should\n- \\[x\\] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\n- \\[x\\] Check that your YAML is registered at\n`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\n- \\[x\\] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\n\\(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing\neval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own\ncases, and we may consider merging them in the future.\\)\n## Final checklist 👀\n### Submission agreement\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic\nand data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have\nadequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the\nright to use this data in future service improvements to our product.\nContributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage\nPolicies \\(<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>\\).\n- \\[x\\] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT\nlicense and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\n### Email address validation\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a\nlimited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email\naddress associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\n- \\[x\\] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if\napplicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission,\nhelp improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the\nrequirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will\nnot be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who\nopens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to\nset the right expectation before you open this PR.\n- \\[x\\] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements\nabove, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be\ngranted.\n### Submit eval\n- \\[x\\] I have filled out all required fields of this form\n- \\[x\\] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\n- \\[x\\] \\(Ignore if not submitting code\\) I have run `pip install\npre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`,\n`isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being\nclosed.\n### Eval JSON data\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as\nmany Eval Samples \\(at least 5\\) from their contribution here:\n<details>\n <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\n ### Eval\n ```jsonl\n{\"eval\": \"belarusian-rhyme.dev.v0\", \"instruction\": \"For each pair of\nwords, determine whether some of their Belarusian translations rhyme.

eval! ♥️\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow\nthe guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**.\nNote that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR\nwill be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that\nright now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if\nthe eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep\nin mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval,\nwe will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing\nthe task.\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval\nperformance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able\nto see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum\neval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and\ncontribute evals.**\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON\nfiles, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before\nsubmitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available\n\\[here\\]\\(https://git-lfs.com\\).\n## Eval details 📑\n### Eval name\nself_prompting\n### Eval description\nIn the Self-Prompting eval, models \\(Prompters\\) write prompts for other\nmodels \\(Taskers\\) to perform various tasks. The effectiveness of the\nPrompters are measured in terms of the accuracy of downstream Taskers on\nthe tasks \\(which are other evals from this repository\\).\n### What makes this a useful eval?\nWe want to closely monitor when AI systems may reach human-level or\nbeyond in AI R&D. In LLM R&D, key avenues for augmenting an existing LM\ninclude fine-tuning, prompting, and external tooling. This eval focuses\non prompting: How well can LMs write prompts for themselves to perform\nvarious tasks? \\(This is also relevant for LLMs being able to deploy\ncopies of themselves.\\)\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general,\nwe are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite\nbeing capable of generating a good response \\(note that there are some\nthings large language models cannot do, so those would not make good\nevals\\).\nYour eval should be:\n- \\[x\\] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically\nconsistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some\nparticular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases\nwhere the model fails to reason about the physical world.\n- \\[x\\] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4\nor GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\n- \\[x\\] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means\neither a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded\neval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria`\nModel-graded eval.\n- \\[x\\] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please\ndocument it below.\n### Unique eval value\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.\n\\(Not required\\)\n## Eval structure 🏗️\nYour eval should\n- \\[x\\] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\n- \\[x\\] Check that your YAML is registered at\n`evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\n- \\[x\\] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\n\\(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing\neval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own\ncases, and we may consider merging them in the future.\\)\n## Final checklist 👀\n### Submission agreement\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic\nand data under the same MIT license as this repository.

Dashboard. [Get started →](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals)\n\nEvals provide a framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) or systems built using LLMs. We offer an existing registry of evals to test different dimensions of OpenAI models and the ability to write your own custom evals for use cases you care about. You can also use your data to build private evals which represent the common LLMs patterns in your workflow without exposing any of that data publicly.\n\nIf you are building with LLMs, creating high quality evals is one of the most impactful things you can do. Without evals, it can be very difficult and time intensive to understand how different model versions might affect your use case. In the words of [OpenAI's President Greg Brockman](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1733553161884127435):\n\n[![https://x.com/gdb/status/1733553161884127435?s=20](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/35577566/289374940-ce7840ff-43a8-4d88-bb2f-6b207410333b.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.vELPnVySvvsa6VaFnCzYsqlEH3XC3RQzbQu6xecKeMQ)](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/35577566/289374940-ce7840ff-43a8-4d88-bb2f-6b207410333b.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.vELPnVySvvsa6VaFnCzYsqlEH3XC3RQzbQu6xecKeMQ)\n\n## Setup\n\n[](#setup)\n\nTo run evals, you will need to set up and specify your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). After you obtain an API key, specify it using the [`OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key). Please be aware of the [costs](https://openai.com/pricing) associated with using the API when running evals. You can also run and create evals using [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/openai-evals/reports/OpenAI-Evals-Demo-Using-W-B-Prompts-to-Run-Evaluations--Vmlldzo0MTI4ODA3).\n\n**Minimum Required Version: Python 3.9**\n\n### Downloading evals\n\n[](#downloading-evals)\n\nOur evals registry is stored using [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). Once you have downloaded and installed LFS, you can fetch the evals (from within your local copy of the evals repo) with:\n\n```\ncd evals git lfs fetch --all git lfs pull\n```\n\nThis will populate all the pointer files under `evals/registry/data`.\n\nYou may just want to fetch data for a select eval. You can achieve this via:\n\n```\ngit lfs fetch --include=evals/registry/data/${your eval} git lfs pull\n```\n\n### Making evals\n\n[](#making-evals)\n\nIf you are going to be creating evals, we suggest cloning this repo directly from GitHub and installing the requirements using the following command:\n\n```\npip install -e .\n```\n\nUsing `-e`, changes you make to your eval will be reflected immediately without having to reinstall.\n\nOptionally, you can install the formatters for pre-committing with:\n\n```\npip install -e .[formatters]\n```\n\nThen run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit into your git hooks. pre-commit will now run on every commit.\n\nIf you want to manually run all pre-commit hooks on a repository, run `pre-commit run --all-files`. To run individual hooks use `pre-commit run <hook_id>`.\n\n## Running evals\n\n[](#running-evals)\n\nIf you don't want to contribute new evals, but simply want to run them locally, you can install the evals package via pip:\n\n```\npip install evals\n```\n\nYou can find the full instructions to run existing evals in [`run-evals.md`](/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/run-evals.md) and our existing eval templates in [`eval-templates.md`](/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/eval-templates.md). For more advanced use cases like prompt chains or tool-using agents, you can use our [Completion Function Protocol](/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/completion-fns.md).\n\nWe provide the option for you to log your eval results to a Snowflake database, if you have one or wish to set one up. For this option, you will further have to specify the `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`, `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`, `SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME`, and `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` environment variables.\n\n## Writing evals\n\n[](#writing-evals)\n\nWe suggest getting starting by:\n\n  * Walking through the process for building an eval: [`build-eval.md`](/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/build-eval.md)\n  * Exploring an example of implementing custom eval logic: [`custom-eval.md`](/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/custom-eval.md)\n  * Writing your own completion functions: [`completion-fns.md`](/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/completion-fns.md)\n  * Review our starter guide for writing evals: [Getting Started with OpenAI Evals](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/evaluation/getting_started_with_openai_evals)\n\n\n\nPlease note that we are currently not accepting evals with custom code! While we ask you to not submit such evals at the moment, you can still submit model-graded evals with custom model-graded YAML files.\n\nIf you think you have an interesting eval, please open a pull request with your contribution. OpenAI staff actively review these evals when considering improvements to upcoming models.\n\n## FAQ\n\n[](#faq)\n\nDo you have any examples of how to build an eval from start to finish?\n\n  * Yes! These are in the `examples` folder. We recommend that you also read through [`build-eval.md`](/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/build-eval.md) in order to gain a deeper understanding of what is happening in these examples.\n\n\n\nDo you have any examples of evals implemented in multiple different ways?\n\n  * Yes! In particular, see `evals/registry/evals/coqa.yaml`. We have implemented small subsets of the [CoQA](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/coqa/) dataset for various eval templates to help illustrate the differences.\n\n\n\nWhen I run an eval, it sometimes hangs at the very end (after the final report). What's going on?\n\n  * This is a known issue, but you should be able to interrupt it safely and the eval should finish immediately after.\n\n\n\nThere's a lot of code, and I just want to spin up a quick eval. Help? OR,\n\nI am a world-class prompt engineer. I choose not to code. How can I contribute my wisdom?\n\n  * If you follow an existing [eval template](/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/eval-templates.md) to build a basic or model-graded eval, you don't need to write any evaluation code at all! Just provide your data in JSON format and specify your eval parameters in YAML. [build-eval.md](/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/build-eval.md) walks you through these steps, and you can supplement these instructions with the Jupyter notebooks in the `examples` folder to help you get started quickly. Keep in mind, though, that a good eval will inevitably require careful thought and rigorous experimentation!\n\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n[](#disclaimer)\n\nBy contributing to evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository.
