This repo provides a curated list to help you navigate so that you are more likely to build production-grade LLM applications. It includes a collection of Large Language Model frameworks and tutorials, covering model training, serving, fine-tuning, LLM applications & prompt optimization, and LLMOps.\n\n\n\n_However, classical ML is not going away. Even LLMs need them. We have seen classical models used for protecting data privacy, detecing hallucinations, and more. So, do not forget to study the fundamentals of classical ML._\n\n## Overview\n\n[](#overview)\n\nThe current workflow might look like this: You build a demo using an existing application library or directly from LLM model provider SDKs. It works somehow, but you need to further create evaluation and training datasets to optimize the performance (e.g., accuracy, latency, cost).\n\nYou can do prompt engineering or auto-prompt optimization; you can create a larger dataset to fine-tune the LLM or use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the model with human preferences. Then you need to consider the serving and LLMOps to deploy the model at scale and pipelines to refresh the data.\n\nWe organize the resources by (1) tracking all libraries, frameworks, and tools, (2) learning resources on the whole LLM lifecycle, (3) understanding LLMs, (4) social accounts and community, and (5) how to contribute to this repo.\n\n  * [LLM-engineer-handbook](#llm-engineer-handbook)\n    * [Overview](#overview)\n  * [Libraries & Frameworks & Tools](#libraries--frameworks--tools)\n    * [Applications](#applications)\n    * [Pretraining](#pretraining)\n    * [Fine-tuning](#fine-tuning)\n    * [Serving](#serving)\n    * [Prompt Management](#prompt-management)\n    * [Datasets](#datasets)\n    * [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)\n  * [Learning Resources for LLMs](#learning-resources-for-llms)\n    * [Applications](#applications-1)\n      * [Agent](#agent)\n    * [Modeling](#modeling)\n    * [Training](#training)\n    * [Fine-tuning](#fine-tuning-1)\n    * [Fundamentals](#fundamentals)\n    * [Books](#books)\n    * [Newsletters](#newsletters)\n    * [Auto-optimization](#auto-optimization)\n  * [Understanding LLMs](#understanding-llms)\n  * [Social Accounts & Community](#social-accounts--community)\n    * [Social Accounts](#social-accounts)\n    * [Community](#community)\n  * [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n\n\n# Libraries & Frameworks & Tools\n\n[](#libraries--frameworks--tools)\n\n## Applications\n\n[](#applications)\n\n**Build & Auto-optimize**\n\n  * [AdalFlow](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow) -
