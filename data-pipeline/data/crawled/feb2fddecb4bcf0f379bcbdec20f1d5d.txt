## Designed for human-agent collaboration

With built-in statefulness, LangGraph agents seamlessly collaborate with humans by writing drafts for review and awaiting approval before acting. Easily inspect the agent’s actions and "time-travel" to roll back and take a different action to correct course.

## LangGraph FAQs

Do I need to use LangChain to use LangGraph? What’s the difference?

No. LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents. LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows. 

How is LangGraph different from other agent frameworks?

Other agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for complex tasks bespoke to a company’s needs. LangGraph provides a more expressive framework to handle companies’ unique tasks without restricting users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.

Does LangGraph impact the performance of my app?

LangGraph will not add any overhead to your code and is specifically designed with streaming workflows in mind.

Is LangGraph open source? Is it free?

Yes. LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.

How are LangGraph and LangGraph Platform different?

LangGraph is a stateful, orchestration framework that brings added control to agent workflows. LangGraph Platform is a service for deploying and scaling LangGraph applications, with an opinionated API for building agent UXs, plus an integrated developer studio.

What are my deployment options for LangGraph Platform?

We currently have the following deployment options for LangGraph applications:‍**Self-Hosted Lite** : A free (up to 1M nodes executed), limited version of LangGraph Platform that you can run locally or in a self-hosted manner. This version requires a LangSmith API key and logs all usage to LangSmith. Fewer features are available than in paid plans.‍**Cloud SaaS:** Fully managed and hosted as part of LangSmith, with automatic updates and zero maintenance.‍**Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC):** Deploy LangGraph Platform within your VPC, provisioned and run as a service. Keep data in your environment while outsourcing the management of the service.**Self-Hosted Enterprise:** Deploy LangGraph entirely on your own infrastructure.

Is LangGraph Platform open source?

No. LangGraph Platform is proprietary software.There is a free, self-hosted version of LangGraph Platform with access to basic features. The Cloud SaaS deployment option is free while in beta, but will eventually be a paid service. We will always give ample notice before charging for a service and reward our early adopters with preferential pricing. The Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) and Self-Hosted Enterprise options are also paid services. [Contact our sales team](/contact-sales) to learn more.For more information, see our [LangGraph Platform pricing page](/pricing-langgraph-platform).
