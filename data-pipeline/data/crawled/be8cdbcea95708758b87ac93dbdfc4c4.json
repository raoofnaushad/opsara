We use HuggingFace’s Optimum-Neuron software development kit (SDK) to apply LoRA to fine-tuning jobs, and use SageMaker HyperPod as the primary compute cluster to perform distributed training on Trainium. Using LoRA supervised fine-tuning for Meta Llama 3 models, you can further reduce your cost to fine tune models by up to 50% and reduce the training time by 70%.\n\n[![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2024/12/19/featured-images-ML-17661-1024x576.jpg)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-preparing-your-own-dataset-for-llm-training/)\n\n## [An introduction to preparing your own dataset for LLM training](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-preparing-your-own-dataset-for-llm-training/)\n\nby Simon Zamarin, David Ping, Vikram Elango, Graham Horwood, Vikesh Pandey, Qingwei Li, and Vinayak Arannil on 19 DEC 2024 in [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/amazon-machine-learning/amazon-bedrock/ \"View all posts in Amazon Bedrock\"), [Amazon Machine Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/amazon-machine-learning/ \"View all posts in Amazon Machine Learning\"), [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/sagemaker/ \"View all posts in Amazon SageMaker\") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-preparing-your-own-dataset-for-llm-training/) [ Comments](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-preparing-your-own-dataset-for-llm-training/#Comments) [ Share](#)\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-preparing-your-own-dataset-for-llm-training/)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=An%20introduction%20to%20preparing%20your%20own%20dataset%20for%20LLM%20training&via=awscloud&url=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-preparing-your-own-dataset-for-llm-training/)\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=An%20introduction%20to%20preparing%20your%20own%20dataset%20for%20LLM%20training&source=Amazon%20Web%20Services&url=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-preparing-your-own-dataset-for-llm-training/)\n  * \n\n\nIn this blog post, we provide an introduction to preparing your own dataset for LLM training.

They generate more accurate predictions through combining the predictions of multiple models. Pipelines can quickly be used to create and end-to-end ML pipeline for ensemble models. This enables developers to build highly accurate models while maintaining efficiency, and reproducibility. In this post, we provide an example of an ensemble model that was trained and deployed using Pipelines.\n\n[![Solution overview](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2024/11/26/ML-17458-arch_diagram-1024x575.png)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/implementing-login-node-load-balancing-in-sagemaker-hyperpod-for-enhanced-multi-user-experience/)\n\n## [Implementing login node load balancing in SageMaker HyperPod for enhanced multi-user experience](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/implementing-login-node-load-balancing-in-sagemaker-hyperpod-for-enhanced-multi-user-experience/)\n\nby Janosch Woschitz and Giuseppe Angelo Porcelli on 13 DEC 2024 in [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/sagemaker/ \"View all posts in Amazon SageMaker\"), [Amazon SageMaker HyperPod](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/artificial-intelligence/sagemaker/amazon-sagemaker-hyperpod/ \"View all posts in Amazon SageMaker HyperPod\"), [Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/post-types/best-practices/ \"View all posts in Best Practices\"), [Expert (400)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/learning-levels/expert-400/ \"View all posts in Expert \\(400\\)\"), [Technical How-to](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/category/post-types/technical-how-to/ \"View all posts in Technical How-to\") [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/implementing-login-node-load-balancing-in-sagemaker-hyperpod-for-enhanced-multi-user-experience/) [ Comments](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/implementing-login-node-load-balancing-in-sagemaker-hyperpod-for-enhanced-multi-user-experience/#Comments) [ Share](#)\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/implementing-login-node-load-balancing-in-sagemaker-hyperpod-for-enhanced-multi-user-experience/)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Implementing%20login%20node%20load%20balancing%20in%20SageMaker%20HyperPod%20for%20enhanced%20multi-user%20experience&via=awscloud&url=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/implementing-login-node-load-balancing-in-sagemaker-hyperpod-for-enhanced-multi-user-experience/)\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Implementing%20login%20node%20load%20balancing%20in%20SageMaker%20HyperPod%20for%20enhanced%20multi-user%20experience&source=Amazon%20Web%20Services&url=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/implementing-login-node-load-balancing-in-sagemaker-hyperpod-for-enhanced-multi-user-experience/)\n  * \n\n\nIn this post, we explore a solution for implementing load balancing across login nodes in Slurm-based HyperPod clusters. By distributing user activity evenly across all available nodes, this approach provides more consistent performance, better resource utilization, and a smoother experience for all users. We guide you through the setup process, providing practical steps to achieve effective load balancing in your HyperPod clusters.\n\n[← Older
