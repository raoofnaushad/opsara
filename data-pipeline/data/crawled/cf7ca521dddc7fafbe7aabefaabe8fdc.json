\n\n![](https://neptune.ai/wp-content/themes/neptune/img/icon-meta-date.svg) 25th September, 2024 \n\n[ML Tools](https://neptune.ai/blog/category/machine-learning-tools)[MLOps](https://neptune.ai/blog/category/mlops)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 3 2'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nAs you delve into the landscape of [MLOps](/blog/mlops) in 2024, you will find a plethora of tools and platforms that have gained traction and are shaping the way models are developed, deployed, and monitored. To provide you with a comprehensive overview, this article explores the key players in the MLOps and FMOps (or LLMOps) ecosystems, encompassing both open-source and closed-source tools, with a focus on highlighting their key features and contributions.\n\n## MLOps landscape\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of the MLOps landscape in 2024 is the coexistence of both open-source and closed-source solutions. [Open-source MLOps tools](/blog/best-open-source-mlops-tools) have gained significant traction due to their flexibility, community support, and adaptability to various workflows. On the other hand, closed-source platforms often provide enterprise-grade features, enhanced security, and dedicated user support.\n\nHere’s an overview diagram of what the landscape looks like in 2024:\n\n[![MLOps and LLMOps landscape in 2024](https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MLOps-Landscape.png?resize=1920%2C926&ssl=1)](https://neptune.ai/mlops-landscape-3)_MLOps and LLMOps landscape in 202_ 4\n\nThe rest of this article will focus on highlighting over 90 MLOps tools and platforms on the market in 2024 in the following categories:\n\n  * End-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) platforms\n  * Experiment tracking, model metadata storage and management\n  * Dataset labeling and annotation\n  * Data storage and versioning\n  * Data quality monitoring and management\n  * Feature stores\n  * Model hubs\n  * Model quality testing\n  * Workflow orchestration and pipelining tools\n  * Model deployment and serving\n  * Model observability\n  * Responsible AI\n  * Compute and infrastructure\n  * GPU Cloud Servers\n  * [NEW] Serverless GPUs\n  * [NEW] Vector databases and data retrieval\n  * [NEW] Foundation model training frameworks\n\n\n\nBy providing an inclusive overview of the LLMOps and MLOps tools and MLOps platforms that emerged in 2024, this article will equip you with a better understanding of the diverse tooling landscape, enabling you to make informed decisions in your MLOps journey.\n\n## How to evaluate MLOps tools and platforms\n\nLike every software solution, evaluating [MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)](/blog/mlops) tools and platforms can be a complex task as it requires consideration of varying factors. Below, you will find some key factors to consider when assessing MLOps tools and platforms, depending on your needs and preferences.\n\n  * 1 Cloud and technology strategy \n  * 2 Alignment to other tools in the organization’s tech stack \n  * 3 Commercial details \n  * 4 Knowledge and skills in the organization \n  * 5 Key use cases and/or user journeys \n  * 6 User support arrangements \n  * 7 Active user community and future roadmap \n\n\n\n### Cloud and technology strategy\n\nChoose an MLOps tool that aligns with your cloud provider or technology stack and supports the frameworks and languages you use for ML development. For example, if you use AWS, you may prefer Amazon SageMaker as an MLOps platform that integrates with other AWS services.\n\n### Alignment to other tools in the organization’s tech stack\n\nConsider how well the MLOps tool integrates with your existing tools and workflows, such as data sources, data engineering platforms, code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, etc. For example, [neptune.ai as an experiment tracker](/product/experiment-tracking), integrates with over 30 MLOps tools and platforms.\n\n### Commercial details\n\nConsider the commercial details when evaluating MLOps tools and platforms. Assess the pricing models, including any hidden costs, and ensure they fit your budget and scaling requirements. Review vendor support and maintenance terms (SLAs and SLOs), contractual agreements, and negotiation flexibility to align with your organization’s needs. Free trials or proof of concepts (PoCs) can help you evaluate the tool’s value before committing to a commercial agreement.\n\n### Knowledge and skills in the organization\n\nEvaluate the level of expertise and experience of your ML team and choose a tool that matches their skill set and learning curve. For example, if your team is proficient in Python and R, you may want an MLOps tool that supports open data formats like Parquet, JSON, CSV, etc., and Pandas or Apache Spark DataFrames.\n\n[ ![](https://neptune.ai/wp-content/themes/neptune/img/icon-related--article.svg) Related post  The Best Tools, Libraries, Frameworks and Methodologies that ML Teams Actually Use [Things We Learned from 41 ML Startups]  Read more  ![](https://neptune.ai/wp-content/themes/neptune/img/icon-button-arrow-right.svg) ](/blog/tools-libraries-frameworks-methodologies-ml-startups-roundup)\n\n### Key use cases and/or user journeys\n\nIdentify the main business problems and the data scientist’s needs that you want to solve with ML, and choose a tool that can handle them effectively. For example, if your team works on recommender systems or [natural language processing](/blog/category/natural-language-processing) applications, you may want an MLOps tool that has built-in algorithms or templates for these use cases.\n\n### User support arrangements\n\nConsider the availability and quality of support from the provider or vendor, including documentation, tutorials, forums, customer service, etc. Also, check the frequency and stability of updates and improvements to the tool.\n\n### Active user community and future roadmap\n\nConsider a tool that has a strong and active community of users and developers who can provide feedback, insights, and best practices.
