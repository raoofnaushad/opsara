**Feature Ingestion API:** What APIs and languages are supported for writing features to the feature store?

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f32a0dcc815d2a49c58481a/61d31926c8bd4184d185548d_tool.svg)

**Write Amplification:** Do you write your features more than once - .e.g, write to stable storage first, then run a separate job to ingest features?

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f32a0dcc815d2a49c58481a/61d31926c8bd4184d185548d_tool.svg)

**Training API (PIT Join Engine):** When you create training data from reusable features, you need to join the feature values together. What compute engine is used to perform this point-in-time JOIN?

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f32a0dcc815d2a49c58481a/61d31926c8bd4184d185548d_tool.svg)

**Training Data:** How is the training data made available to machine learning frameworks? As dataframes or files?

# Build or Buy

Developing a software can be extremely **costly** and **time-consuming** so reusability of different systems proves to be a reasonable solution, however the number of companies **building their own feature store** is on the rise.Learn more about the industry's conundrum by watching the relevant panel discussion from the first **Feature Store Summit.**
