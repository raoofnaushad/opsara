# Argo Workflows

Kubernetes-native workflow engine supporting DAG and step-based workflows.

[ Documentation ](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## What is Argo Workflows?

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD.

  * Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
  * Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a graph (DAG).
  * Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.
  * Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.



## Why Argo Workflows?

  * Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.
  * Cloud agnostic and can run on any Kubernetes cluster.
  * Easily orchestrate highly parallel jobs on Kubernetes.
  * Argo Workflows puts a cloud-scale supercomputer at your fingertips!
