# Cookiecutter

[](#cookiecutter)

Create projects swiftly from **cookiecutters** (project templates) with this command-line utility. Ideal for generating Python package projects and more.

  * [Documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io)
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
  * [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/)
  * [License (BSD)](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/blob/main/LICENSE)



## Installation

[](#installation)

Install cookiecutter using pip package manager:

```
`# pipx is strongly recommended. pipx install cookiecutter # If pipx is not an option, # you can install cookiecutter in your Python user directory. python -m pip install --user cookiecutter `
```

## Features

[](#features)

  * **Cross-Platform:** Supports Windows, Mac, and Linux.
  * **User-Friendly:** No Python knowledge required.
  * **Versatile:** Compatible with Python 3.7 to 3.12.
  * **Multi-Language Support:** Use templates in any language or markup format.



### For Users

[](#for-users)

#### Quick Start

[](#quick-start)

The recommended way to use Cookiecutter as a command line utility is to run it with [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), which can be installed with `pip install pipx`, but if you plan to use Cookiecutter programmatically, please run `pip install cookiecutter`.

**Use a GitHub template**

```
# You'll be prompted to enter values. # Then it'll create your Python package in the current working directory, # based on those values. # For the sake of brevity, repos on GitHub can just use the 'gh' prefix $ pipx run cookiecutter gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage
```

**Use a local template**

```
$ pipx run cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/
```

**Use it from Python**

```
from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/') # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template cookiecutter('gh:audreyfeldroy//cookiecutter-pypackage.git')
```

#### Detailed Usage

[](#detailed-usage)

  * Generate projects from local or remote templates.
  * Customize projects with `cookiecutter.json` prompts.
  * Utilize pre-prompt, pre- and post-generate hooks.



[Learn More](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)

### For Template Creators

[](#for-template-creators)

  * Utilize unlimited directory nesting.
  * Employ Jinja2 for all templating needs.
  * Define template variables easily with `cookiecutter.json`.
