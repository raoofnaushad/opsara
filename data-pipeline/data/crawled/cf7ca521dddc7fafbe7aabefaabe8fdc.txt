## How to evaluate MLOps tools and platforms

Like every software solution, evaluating [MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)](/blog/mlops) tools and platforms can be a complex task as it requires consideration of varying factors. Below, you will find some key factors to consider when assessing MLOps tools and platforms, depending on your needs and preferences.

  * 1 Cloud and technology strategy 
  * 2 Alignment to other tools in the organization’s tech stack 
  * 3 Commercial details 
  * 4 Knowledge and skills in the organization 
  * 5 Key use cases and/or user journeys 
  * 6 User support arrangements 
  * 7 Active user community and future roadmap 



### Cloud and technology strategy

Choose an MLOps tool that aligns with your cloud provider or technology stack and supports the frameworks and languages you use for ML development. For example, if you use AWS, you may prefer Amazon SageMaker as an MLOps platform that integrates with other AWS services.

### Alignment to other tools in the organization’s tech stack

Consider how well the MLOps tool integrates with your existing tools and workflows, such as data sources, data engineering platforms, code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, etc. For example, [neptune.ai as an experiment tracker](/product/experiment-tracking), integrates with over 30 MLOps tools and platforms.

### Commercial details

Consider the commercial details when evaluating MLOps tools and platforms. Assess the pricing models, including any hidden costs, and ensure they fit your budget and scaling requirements. Review vendor support and maintenance terms (SLAs and SLOs), contractual agreements, and negotiation flexibility to align with your organization’s needs. Free trials or proof of concepts (PoCs) can help you evaluate the tool’s value before committing to a commercial agreement.

### Knowledge and skills in the organization

Evaluate the level of expertise and experience of your ML team and choose a tool that matches their skill set and learning curve. For example, if your team is proficient in Python and R, you may want an MLOps tool that supports open data formats like Parquet, JSON, CSV, etc., and Pandas or Apache Spark DataFrames.

### Key use cases and/or user journeys

Identify the main business problems and the data scientist’s needs that you want to solve with ML, and choose a tool that can handle them effectively. For example, if your team works on recommender systems or [natural language processing](/blog/category/natural-language-processing) applications, you may want an MLOps tool that has built-in algorithms or templates for these use cases.

### User support arrangements

Consider the availability and quality of support from the provider or vendor, including documentation, tutorials, forums, customer service, etc. Also, check the frequency and stability of updates and improvements to the tool.

### Active user community and future roadmap

Consider a tool that has a strong and active community of users and developers who can provide feedback, insights, and best practices. In addition to considering the vendor’s reputation, ensure you can be positioned to receive updates, see the roadmap of the tool, and see how they align with your goal.

## End-to-end MLOps platforms

## LLMOps and foundation model training frameworks 

Apart from the “traditional” [model training frameworks](/blog/top-10-best-machine-learning-tools-for-model-training) like [PyTorch 2.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/), [TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions), and other model training tools that have remained consistent in the landscape over the past decade, some new tools have emerged in 2024 for training and fine-tuning foundation models.

### Guardrails

[Guardrails](https://shreyar.github.io/guardrails/#rail-spec) is an open-source Python package that lets your data scientist add structure, type, and quality guarantees to the outputs of large language models (LLMs). Guardrails:

– Does pydantic-style validation of LLM outputs. This includes semantic validation such as checking for bias in generated text, checking for bugs in generated code, etc.

– Takes corrective actions (e.g. asking LLM again) when validation fails,

– Enforces structure and type guarantees (e.g., JSON).

### LangChain

[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) is an open-source framework for building applications that use large language models (LLMs). It provides a number of features that make it easy to use LLMs, including:

  * An API for interacting with LLMs.
  * Out-of-the-box pre-trained LLMs.
  * Tools for fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks.
  * Example applications that use LLMs.



### LLamaIndex

[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) is a simple, flexible interface between your external data and LLMs. It provides the following tools in an easy-to-use fashion:

  * Data connectors to your existing data sources and data formats (API’s, PDF’s, docs, SQL, etc.)
  * Indices over your unstructured and structured data for use with LLM’s. These indices help to abstract away common boilerplate and pain points for in-context learning: 
    * Storing context in an easy-to-access format for prompt insertion.
    * Dealing with prompt limitations (e.g. 4096 tokens for Davinci) when context is too big.
    * Dealing with text splitting.
  * An interface for users to query the index (feed in an input prompt) and obtain a knowledge-augmented output.
  * A comprehensive toolset, trading off cost and performance.



### DUST

[Dust](https://github.com/dust-tt/dust) is designed to provide a flexible framework to define and deploy large language model apps without having to write any execution code. It is specifically intended to ease:

  * Working on multiple examples simultaneously while designing a large language model app.
  * Introspecting model outputs produced by intermediary steps of large language model apps.
  * Iterating on the design of large language model apps by providing a granular and automated versioning system.



## Conclusion

The MLOps and LLMOps landscape featured a diverse array of tools and platforms aimed at enabling organizations and individuals to effectively manage either part or the full end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. The dynamic ecosystem encompassed both open-source and commercial offerings, addressing various stages of the ML workflow. The field was rapidly evolving, giving practitioners plenty of choices to operationalize machine learning effectively.

## MLOps tools and platforms FAQ

### What devops tools are used in machine learning in 2024?

Some of the popular DevOps tools in the machine learning space include:

  * C[ontinuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tools](/blog/continuous-integration-continuous-deployment-tools-for-machine-learning) like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) are gaining more adoption to enable automated testing, integration, and deployment of machine learning models.
  * [Containerization tools ](/blog/kubernetes-vs-docker-for-machine-learning-engineer)such as Docker and Kubernetes used to package machine learning models, dependencies, and infrastructure configurations are still dominating.
  * Configuration management tools like [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/), and [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) used to automate the configuration and provisioning of infrastructure, are seeing lesser uptake as more operable and maintainable MLOps platforms emerge. 



### What MLOps frameworks work with sensitive data?

There are several MLOps frameworks that prioritize data privacy and can be used with sensitive data. Some of these frameworks include:

[TensorFlow Privacy](https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy) provides tools and techniques for training models on sensitive data in TensorFlow while incorporating privacy safeguards like differential privacy and federated learning.

[PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) enables secure and private machine learning by implementing techniques such as federated learning, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation (MPC).[Intel OpenVINO](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) (Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization) toolkit provides optimizations for running machine learning models on Intel hardware. It includes features for enhancing privacy and security, such as model encryption, tamper-resistant model execution, and secure inference.
