Yet, this is a fundamental limitation of current vector similarity search-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) used in many LLM chatbots today. Thankfully, most vector DBs have implemented capabilities to filter the vector similarity search results using some metadata filters. For example, if you index a list of book descriptions in your vector DB, you might also attach metadata regarding the book's author, year of publication, genre, price, etc. So, the technology exists, but how do you extract the exact value to apply to these metadata filters from the user's natural language query? Enter the Self-Query Retriever from [LangChain](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langchain?trk=public_post-text) ([https://lnkd.in/gCis723F](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgCis723F&urlhash=AzmE&trk=public_post-text)) or [LlamaIndex](https://www.linkedin.com/company/llamaindex?trk=public_post-text) ([https://lnkd.in/gVUk-nFX](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgVUk-nFX&urlhash=JkVu&trk=public_post-text)) but is also straightforward to implement from scratch: 1. Construct a filter extraction prompt instructing an LLM to extract filter conditions and values in a standard format: e.g., \"gt\" for greater than, \"eq\" for equal, etc. See the detailed prompt here: [https://lnkd.in/gBBFHMX4](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgBBFHMX4&urlhash=sl-6&trk=public_post-text). Customising the examples to your exact metadata is very important to improve reliability! 2. Send this prompt and the user's question to an LLM and parse the response. The output is the extracted metadata filters in a generic vectorDB-agnostic format. For example, if your user's question is \"I want to buy perfume less than $50,\" the output would look like \"lt(price,50).\" 3. Use Langchain's translators to convert it to your required vector DB format. A complete list of supported vector DBs is here: [https://lnkd.in/gq3x68vi](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fgq3x68vi&urlhash=idT5&trk=public_post-text) 4. Finally, you can directly use the translated format in your vector DB query to filter the retrieved documents by the metadata fields. In reality, the self-query retriever adds latency to your app, so you'd want to use the fastest LLM possible. GPT3.5 is excellent for this task, but it may still not be fast enough, and I suspect a small, quantized, open-source model might be your best bet. Let me know in the comments if you have any suggestions for trying! For more details on the generic filter format to vectorDB-specific filter format, look at the code in the method visit_structured_query for the [Qdrant](https://de.linkedin.com/company/qdrant?trk=public_post-text) translator here: [https://lnkd.in/gY6hQtT9](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgY6hQtT9&urlhash=7DX5&trk=public_post-text) Edit: there’s discussion about using Knowledge Graphs in the comments that are worth checking out! Instead of converting user’s natural language question into a vectorDB metadata filter query, you’d convert it to a graph cypher query and execute against a graphDB. A very similar but slightly different concept to the gist of my post. Follow me for more tips on building successful ML and LLM products!

We have such great technology now but just because it's great doesn't mean you now need to slot it on every single task. Everything gen AI. This actually leads to worse products as in your case. You don't need semantic search for a simple price filter. This is solved already. Drop-down or slider in standartized shop environment. Easy peasy. But now the customer has to type a full sentence and this needs to be interpreted by the AI correctly (less then 100% accuracy opposing to a logical system) and on top you now semantically search for a product that somehow relates to perfumes or price. So a perfume that is similar to \"buying\" \"perfumes\" or \"price\" instead of retrieving a full list. Likely unintended likely lower NPS than just Standart Filter it. But certainly higher complexity. There is absolutely no need for gen AI here. Pls let's not advocate for this kind of BS (pardon my language) and use this powerful tech for meaningful stuff.\n\n[ Like  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fmarie-stephen-leo_generativeai-llm-nlp-activity-7185079313191301120-k-C3&trk=public_post_comment_like) [ Reply  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fmarie-stephen-leo_generativeai-llm-nlp-activity-7185079313191301120-k-C3&trk=public_post_comment_reply) [ 12 Reactions ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fmarie-stephen-leo_generativeai-llm-nlp-activity-7185079313191301120-k-C3&trk=public_post_comment_reactions) 13 Reactions \n\n[ ](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/yaitbachir?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[ Yann AïtBachir ](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/yaitbachir?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nAI @ Google | I share Career Tips in Tech | 1.9k+ Newsletter Subscribers\n\n9mo \n\n  * [ Report this comment ](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fmarie-stephen-leo_generativeai-llm-nlp-activity-7185079313191301120-k-C3&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n\n\nRAG with blind embedding is indeed a starting point, but as your post highlights, it's no longer sufficient for nuanced user intents. 🎯 Extracting and processing metadata upfront is crucial, not only for improving response accuracy but also for enhancing user experience. Each step of this process—metadata extraction, filtering, and ultimately responding—may benefit from different foundational models tailored to specific functionalities. 🔄 For instance, one model could be optimized for quick and accurate metadata extraction, while another could handle the actual content retrieval more effectively. This segmentation of tasks across specialized models could greatly enhance the precision and speed of the overall system. Leveraging a diverse set of foundation models might be the key to overcoming the limitations of current RAG implementations in LLMs. 🚀\n\n[ Like  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fmarie-stephen-leo_generativeai-llm-nlp-activity-7185079313191301120-k-C3&trk=public_post_comment_like) [ Reply  ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fmarie-stephen-leo_generativeai-llm-nlp-activity-7185079313191301120-k-C3&trk=public_post_comment_reply) [ 13 Reactions ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fmarie-stephen-leo_generativeai-llm-nlp-activity-7185079313191301120-k-C3&trk=public_post_comment_reactions) 14 Reactions \n\n[ ](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ritobrotoseth?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[ Ritobroto Seth ](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ritobrotoseth?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nEngineering at Spotnana | Remote | Backend Developer | AI | Langchain | Java\n\n9mo \n\n  * [ Report this comment ](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fmarie-stephen-leo_generativeai-llm-nlp-activity-7185079313191301120-k-C3&trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n\n\nFor point 2, I would like to recommend the instructor library too.

Yet, this is a fundamental limitation of current vector similarity search-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) used in many LLM chatbots today. Thankfully, most vector DBs have implemented capabilities to filter the vector similarity search results using some metadata filters. For example, if you index a list of book descriptions in your vector DB, you might also attach metadata regarding the book's author, year of publication, genre, price, etc. So, the technology exists, but how do you extract the exact value to apply to these metadata filters from the user's natural language query? Enter the Self-Query Retriever from [LangChain](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langchain?trk=public_post_reshare-text) ([https://lnkd.in/gCis723F](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgCis723F&urlhash=AzmE&trk=public_post_reshare-text)) or [LlamaIndex](https://www.linkedin.com/company/llamaindex?trk=public_post_reshare-text) ([https://lnkd.in/gVUk-nFX](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgVUk-nFX&urlhash=JkVu&trk=public_post_reshare-text)) but is also straightforward to implement from scratch: 1. Construct a filter extraction prompt instructing an LLM to extract filter conditions and values in a standard format: e.g., \"gt\" for greater than, \"eq\" for equal, etc. See the detailed prompt here: [https://lnkd.in/gBBFHMX4](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgBBFHMX4&urlhash=sl-6&trk=public_post_reshare-text). Customising the examples to your exact metadata is very important to improve reliability! 2. Send this prompt and the user's question to an LLM and parse the response. The output is the extracted metadata filters in a generic vectorDB-agnostic format. For example, if your user's question is \"I want to buy perfume less than $50,\" the output would look like \"lt(price,50).\" 3. Use Langchain's translators to convert it to your required vector DB format. A complete list of supported vector DBs is here: [https://lnkd.in/gq3x68vi](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fgq3x68vi&urlhash=idT5&trk=public_post_reshare-text) 4. Finally, you can directly use the translated format in your vector DB query to filter the retrieved documents by the metadata fields. In reality, the self-query retriever adds latency to your app, so you'd want to use the fastest LLM possible. GPT3.5 is excellent for this task, but it may still not be fast enough, and I suspect a small, quantized, open-source model might be your best bet. Let me know in the comments if you have any suggestions for trying! For more details on the generic filter format to vectorDB-specific filter format, look at the code in the method visit_structured_query for the [Qdrant](https://de.linkedin.com/company/qdrant?trk=public_post_reshare-text) translator here: [https://lnkd.in/gY6hQtT9](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgY6hQtT9&urlhash=7DX5&trk=public_post_reshare-text) Edit: there’s discussion about using Knowledge Graphs in the comments that are worth checking out! Instead of converting user’s natural language question into a vectorDB metadata filter query, you’d convert it to a graph cypher query and execute against a graphDB.

Instead of converting user’s natural language question into a vectorDB metadata filter query, you’d convert it to a graph cypher query and execute against a graphDB.

This work describes a novel model, PLLaVA, that enhances video understanding and captioning by fine-tuning image-language pre-trained models to the video data domain. The task at hand targets the development of video applications that will generate coherent natural language descriptions of video content. Why this study was deemed necessary? The study is based on the ground that current methods in video-language understanding need too much computational power and data, hence slowing the progress. The researchers wanted to find a simpler, less resource-intensive way to improve video understanding tasks. What is the innovation? The developed PLLaVA follows a pooling strategy to manage visual features effectively across video frames. This help to reducing the impact of overly main features and improving the quality of video description. How does it work (Methods)? PLLaVA extends prior image-language models by average pooling of the features temporally. It reduces the complexity and size of the data that each model has to handle and process, while maintaining crucial information. What were the key findings? Some of the major findings include that the model, PLLaVA, reaches state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks for video question answering and captioning tasks. It has shown the best performance to date on several benchmark datasets for video question answering and captioning, clearly justifying the effectiveness of this pooling approach. The paper makes major contributions to the introduction of an efficient pooling method to video data and the successful adaptation of image-based models for video understanding, which significantly improves performance without needing a large amount of computational resources. What is the result? And what are some possible future tasks and limitations? Results show that PLLaVA produces accurate and dense video captions, outperforming all previous models such as Open-Sora GPT-4 for accuracy and detail. In so doing, the paper takes into account limitations that may include the dependence on the quality of video datasets and potential issues of scaling when applying the model to extremely large datasets.

Implementing SGE incurs significantly higher costs compared to current methods, potentially impacting ad revenue as searchers’ needs are met more quickly reducing the number of placement opportunities. Schema markup aids Google’s crawlers and machine learning algorithms in understanding web content more efficiently and cost-effectively. It can play a role in reducing Google’s operational costs. The premise is that aiding Google in minimizing the resources needed for crawling, indexing and understanding your site will lead to improved visibility. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝘂𝗽 Descriptive schema markup: Detailed and accurate schema markup that is not deceitful aids Google by lowering NLP costs, facilitated by defining the entities and their relationships on the page. Linking entities: With @id, entities are interlinked, enhancing the description of their relationships. Linking to external data: Using same As external data can be connected to entities on a webpage to increase the descriptiveness of the entity and prove its legitimacy. 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗚𝗘 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 Natural language processing (𝗡𝗟𝗣) has come a long way, especially with the addition of 𝗟𝗟𝗠𝘀, yet still comprehending the web’s vast amount of information remains challenging for any search engine. The more structured data that businesses provide Google, the more verified information they will have to train machine learning algorithms like LLMs effectively. Boosting your chances of inclusion in SGE is a hot topic. However, my perspective is that visibility will increase as more information from a specific source is included in the training data. Combining fresh, unique content with schema markup aligns perfectly with Google’s aim to deploy SGE efficiently, which aims for a neutral or positive revenue impact while reducing operational costs.

It compares the generated translated text to one or more human-created reference translations. The more similar the generated text is to the reference, the higher the BLEU score. 📌 How does it work? BLEU doesn't perform a deep meaning analysis, but rather focuses on how well the translations match on a surface level. It considers factors like: 👉 N-gram precision: How often sequences of n words (e.g., bigrams, trigrams) in the generated text appear in the reference. 👉 Brevity penalty: Penalizes overly concise translations that might miss key information. Imagine translating the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat.\" Good translation: \"La gata se sentó en la alfombra.\" (Spanish) Bad translation: \"Cat sat mat.\" (Short and missing information) The good translation would likely have high n-gram precision because it shares many similar sequences with the reference. The bad translation would be penalized for brevity. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1. A score of 1 indicates perfect similarity between the generated text and the reference. 🔻 Note - BLEU can be a good starting point, but it's not perfect. It doesn't capture the full nuance of translation quality, especially when dealing with different sentence structures or idiomatic expressions. BLEU focuses on surface-level similarity, not semantic meaning. It doesn't assess if the translated text conveys the same intent or factual accuracy as the original. An LLM might achieve a high BLEU score by producing grammatically correct but nonsensical translations.

These algorithms analyze the query, match it with indexed web content, and rank the results based on relevance and quality. Essentially, search engines function as digital librarians, sorting through vast amounts of web pages to present the most pertinent information. 📌 Semantic search: Semantic search enhances information retrieval by understanding the deeper meaning behind queries. Unlike traditional keyword matching, semantic search interprets user intent and context, which leads to more accurate and relevant results. It excels in recognizing synonyms and variations of terms, ensuring users find what they seek even if their input differs slightly from indexed terms. This approach is particularly effective for broad concepts and nuanced language. 🗓 Vector Search: Vector search is a powerful method for navigating and exploring extensive datasets by converting data into geometric representations called vectors. These vectors numerically represent the essence of content, such as words, phrases, or documents. Vector search measures similarity and relationships between entities with high precision, making it efficient for handling large datasets and enhancing content relevance through advanced data representation. ⚖ Semantic search vs. Vector search: While both semantic and vector search have unique strengths, their synergy can create a robust information retrieval system. ✅ Semantic search: Excels in understanding user intent and context, making it ideal for queries involving nuanced language or broad concepts. ☑ Vector Search: Efficiently processes vast datasets and leverages machine learning to enhance content relevance. 🚀 Combining semantic search's deep query understanding with vector search's precise data representation can balance precision and scalability, resulting in a powerful and efficient information retrieval system.

This formidable model has seized the throne from its predecessor, sup-SimCSE-VietNamese-phobert-base [2], boasting an impressive score of 4 in both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. With a Pearson correlation of 88.33 and Spearman correlation of 88.20, it has set a new standard in accuracy and performance. But how did it achieve such remarkable success? The answer lies in a sophisticated yet straightforward strategy: more data equals greater efficiency. Building upon the foundation laid by previous models trained with the SimCSE method [3], Đặng Văn Tuấn propelled Vietnamese-embedding to new heights through a meticulously crafted training regimen. This four-stage process unfolded as follows: **Stage 1: Initial Training** *Dataset:* ViNLI-SimCSE-supervised *Method:* Leveraging the SimCSE approach, which employs supervised contrastive learning, the model was primed for learning from annotated sentence pairs using Triplet Loss optimization. **Stage 2: Continued Fine-tuning** *Dataset:* XNLI-vn *Method:* Through continued fine-tuning utilizing Multi-Negative Ranking Loss, the model refined its ability to discern subtle semantic nuances and rank them effectively. **Stage 3: Continued Fine-tuning for Semantic Textual Similarity on STS Benchmark** *Dataset:* STSB-vn *Method:* Tailored fine-tuning for the semantic textual similarity benchmark, utilizing Siamese BERT-Networks powered by the 'sentence-transformers' library, thereby enhancing the model's precision in capturing semantic similarities across diverse Vietnamese texts. **Stage 4: Advanced Augmentation Fine-tuning** *Dataset:* STSB-vn with generated silver samples from gold samples *Method:* Employing an advanced augmentation strategy, the model integrated Augmented SBERT with Pair Sampling Strategies, incorporating both Cross-Encoder and Bi-Encoder models. This innovative approach dynamically enriched the training data, bolstering the model's robustness and accuracy in processing complex Vietnamese language constructs. And thus concludes today's revelation. May this newfound knowledge inspire and inform, as we eagerly anticipate the future strides yet to come. **References:** [1] Vietnamese-embedding: [link]([https://lnkd.in/eiXUErYK](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FeiXUErYK&urlhash=4J8O&trk=public_post-text)) [2] sup-SimCSE-VietNamese-phobert-base: [link]([https://lnkd.in/eK8vhwjz](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FeK8vhwjz&urlhash=my1g&trk=public_post-text)...)

We've developed an advanced search engine algorithm tailored for retrieving subtitles based on user queries. Our approach combines natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance relevance and accuracy of search results. Let's dive into the details: 📚 Semantic Search Engines: Keyword-Based Search Engine: Relies on exact keyword matches. Semantic Search Engines: Understands the meaning and context of queries and documents. 🔑 Core Logic: Preprocessing: Clean and vectorize subtitle documents and user queries. Cosine Similarity Calculation: Compute similarity between document vectors and user query vector. 💻 Step-by-Step Process: Part 1: Ingesting Documents Read and decode subtitle data from the provided database. Applied appropriate cleaning steps and experimented with BOW/TFIDF for keyword-based and BERT-based SentenceTransformers for semantic search engine. Implemented a Document Chunker to handle large documents efficiently. Stored embeddings in a ChromaDB database. Part 2: Retrieving Documents Preprocessed user queries and created query embeddings. Calculated similarity scores using cosine distance to return the most relevant documents. 🚀 Our algorithm leverages state-of-the-art techniques to deliver precise search results, ensuring users find exactly what they need.

The emergence and growth of LLMs have introduced us to \"synthetic data\", a generated instructional raw text used to train [#LLMs](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fllms&trk=public_post-text) for specific tasks, eliminating the need to rely on real human conversations. The generation perception suggests that LLMs have consumed all the data on the Internet to train models effectively. This has raised the question of generating good-quality data for further system training. Consequently, synthetic data has been introduced to train models further. For instance, say we want to build a closed-domain Question-Answering system. We have a dataset (context, question -> answer) that we can use to fine-tune a language model. Each sample consists of multiple paragraphs and is noisy (contains missing figures, unnecessary Unicode characters, and other formatting issues). Our dataset consists of exactly one pair of question-answer for a given context. A synthetic dataset here means an additional pair of generated question-answers for the same context. To complete the above task, GPT-4 or Llama2-70B can be used. We will pass a context as an input prompt to a large language model and ask it to generate a pair of question-answers relevant to the given context. Based on this, these are the possible pitfalls that can emerge: ✔️ Hallucinations: The first image displays a non-trivial type of hallucination. Although the generated text is from the input context, it contains a lot of garbage content. ✔️ Complexity of the synthetic dataset: Over time, easy (low-complexity generated) examples provide diminishing returns in terms of performance. Therefore, we must include more complex examples for better results. An example of a complex question-answer is one where the answer to a question consists of more than a few words. For instance, in the images below, consider choosing between the two based on the complexity of the generated text. While both are good, the second is more complex and nuanced. ✔️ Incomplete or missing text: It isn't uncommon to run into issues like unstructured outputs or outputs with disorderly fields while using a hosted model (like GPT-4) via an API. The image below shows missing generated question. Debugging this behavior is not straightforward, as factors like bad inputs, broken tokenization, lack of constraints, hallucination, etc., could be inducing this behavior. Many other nuances to this process are use-case-dependent, which is why auto-generating synthetic datasets isn't a perfect solution. An automated synthetic dataset generation pipeline is helpful only if it's positively known to be reliable. This isn't to say that using automated synthetic data will not bring positive results; however, producing high-quality and good data is a significant factor in achieving better results.
