Retrieval-Augmented Generation \\(RAG\\) implements pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval optimizations to a naive RAG pipeline](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*8z-QRadKewNmos0J_4TNAQ.png)\n\nDifference between Naive and Advanced RAG (Image by the author, inspired by [1])\n\nA recent survey on [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-theory-to-langchain-implementation-4e9bd5f6a4f2) [1] summarized three recently evolved paradigms:\n\n  * Naive RAG,\n  * advanced RAG, and\n  * modular RAG.\n\n\n\nThe advanced RAG paradigm comprises of a set of techniques targeted at addressing known limitations of naive RAG. This article first discusses these techniques, which can be categorized into _pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval optimizations_.\n\nIn the second half, you will learn how to implement a naive RAG pipeline using [Llamaindex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) in Python, which will then be enhanced to an advanced RAG pipeline with a selection of the following advanced RAG techniques:\n\n  * [Pre-retrieval optimization: Sentence window retrieval](#c968)\n  * [Retrieval optimization: Hybrid search](#3275)\n  * [Post-retrieval optimization: Re-ranking](#c1e2)\n\n\n\nThis article focuses on the **advanced RAG paradigm** and its implementation. If you are unfamiliar with the fundamentals of RAG, you can catch up on it here:\n\n## [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): From Theory to LangChain ImplementationFrom the theory of the original academic paper to its Python implementation with OpenAI, Weaviate, and LangChaintowardsdatascience.com](/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-theory-to-langchain-implementation-4e9bd5f6a4f2?source=post_page-----4de1464a9930--------------------------------)\n\n# What is Advanced RAG\n\nWith the recent advancements in the RAG domain, advanced RAG has evolved as a new paradigm with targeted enhancements to address some of the limitations of the naive RAG paradigm. As summarized in a recent survey [1], advanced RAG techniques can be categorized into pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval optimizations.\n\n![Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation \\(RAG\\) implements pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval optimizations to a naive RAG pipeline](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*6bTQeYn9814yAgLor2EFrQ.png)\n\nDifference between Naive and Advanced RAG (Image by the author, inspired by [1])\n\n# Pre-retrieval optimization\n\nPre-retrieval optimizations focus on data indexing optimizations as well as query optimizations. Data indexing optimization techniques aim to store the data in a way that helps you improve retrieval efficiency, such as [1]:\n\n  * **Sliding window** uses an overlap between chunks and is one of the simplest techniques.\n  * **Enhancing data granularity** applies data cleaning techniques, such as removing irrelevant information, confirming factual accuracy, updating outdated information, etc.\n  * **Adding metadata** , such as dates, purposes, or chapters, for filtering purposes.\n  * **Optimizing index structures** involves different strategies to index data, such as adjusting the chunk sizes or using multi-indexing strategies. One technique we will implement in this article is sentence window retrieval, which embeds single sentences for retrieval and replaces them with a larger text window at inference time.\n\n\n\n![Sentence window retrieval embeds and indexes the document by single sentences but also stored a window of context around the senteces as metadata.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*pbU5KBqYWhx0GOeNRMiPoA.png)\n\nSentence window retrieval\n\nAdditionally, pre-retrieval techniques aren’t limited to data indexing and can cover **techniques at inference time** , such as query routing, query rewriting, and query expansion.\n\n# Retrieval optimization\n\nThe retrieval stage aims to identify the most relevant context. Usually, the retrieval is based on vector search, which calculates the semantic similarity between the query and the indexed data. Thus, the majority of retrieval optimization techniques revolve around the embedding models [1]:\n\n  * **Fine-tuning embedding models** customizes embedding models to domain-specific contexts, especially for domains with evolving or rare terms. For example, `BAAI/bge-small-en `is a high-performance embedding model that can be fine-tuned (see[ Fine-tuning guide](https://betterprogramming.pub/fine-tuning-your-embedding-model-to-maximize-relevance-retrieval-in-rag-pipeline-2ea3fa231149))\n  * **Dynamic Embedding** adapts to the context in which words are used, unlike static embedding, which uses a single vector for each word. For example, OpenAI’s `embeddings-ada-02` is a sophisticated dynamic embedding model that captures contextual understanding. [1]\n\n\n\nThere are also other retrieval techniques besides vector search, such as hybrid search, which often refers to the concept of combining vector search with keyword-based search. This retrieval technique is beneficial if your retrieval requires exact keyword matches.\n\n## [Improving Retrieval Performance in RAG Pipelines with Hybrid SearchHow to find more relevant search results by combining traditional keyword-based search with modern vector searchtowardsdatascience.com](/improving-retrieval-performance-in-rag-pipelines-with-hybrid-search-c75203c2f2f5?source=post_page-----4de1464a9930--------------------------------)\n\n# Post-retrieval optimization\n\nAdditional processing of the retrieved context can help address issues such as exceeding the context window limit or introducing noise, thus hindering the focus on crucial information. Post-retrieval optimization techniques summarized in the RAG survey [1] are:\n\n  * **Prompt compression** reduces the overall prompt length by removing irrelevant and highlighting important context.\n  * **Re-ranking** uses machine learning models to recalculate the relevance scores of the retrieved contexts.\n\n\n\n![Re-ranking recalculates the relevance scores based on the query after the retrieval and only sends the top n to the context window of the LLM](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*owudWLuoXhqeLjStCsnDiw.png)\n\nRe-ranking\n\nFor additional ideas on how to improve the performance of your RAG pipeline to make it production-ready, continue reading here:\n\n## [A Guide on 12 Tuning Strategies for Production-Ready RAG ApplicationsHow to improve the performance of your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with these “hyperparameters” and…towardsdatascience.com](/a-guide-on-12-tuning-strategies-for-production-ready-rag-applications-7ca646833439?source=post_page-----4de1464a9930--------------------------------)\n\n# Prerequisites\n\nThis section discusses the required packages and API keys to follow along in this article.\n\n## Required Packages\n\nThis article will guide you through implementing a naive and an advanced RAG pipeline using [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) in Python.\n\n```\npip install llama-index\n```\n\nIn this article, we will be using [LlamaIndex ](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/llamaindex-v0-10-838e735948f8)`[v0.10](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/llamaindex-v0-10-838e735948f8)`. If you are upgrading from an older LlamaIndex version, you need to run the following commands to install and run LlamaIndex properly:\n\n```\npip uninstall llama-indexpip install llama-index --upgrade --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall\n```\n\nLlamaIndex offers an option to store vector embeddings locally in JSON files for persistent storage, which is great for quickly prototyping an idea. However, we will use a vector database for persistent storage since advanced RAG techniques aim for production-ready applications.\n\nSince we will need metadata storage and hybrid search capabilities in addition to storing the vector embeddings, we will use the open source vector database [Weaviate](http://weaviate.io) (`v3.26.2`), which supports these features.\n\n```\npip install weaviate-client llama-index-vector-stores-weaviate\n```\n\n## API Keys\n\nWe will be using Weaviate embedded, which you can use for free without registering for an API key. However, this tutorial uses an embedding model and LLM from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), for which you will need an OpenAI API key. To obtain one, you need an OpenAI account and then “Create new secret key” under [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n\nNext, create a local `.env` file in your root directory and define your API keys in it:\n\n```\nOPENAI_API_KEY=\"<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>\"\n```\n\nAfterwards, you can load your API keys with the following code:\n\n```\n# !pip install python-dotenvimport osfrom dotenv import load_dotenv,find_dotenvload_dotenv(find_dotenv())\n```\n\n# Implementing Naive RAG with LlamaIndex\n\nThis section discusses how to implement a naive RAG pipeline using LlamaIndex. You can find the entire naive RAG pipeline in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/integrations/llamaindex/retrieval-augmented-generation/naive_rag.ipynb). For the implementation using LangChain, you can continue in [this article (naive RAG pipeline using LangChain](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-theory-to-langchain-implementation-4e9bd5f6a4f2)).\n\n## Step 1: Define the embedding model and LLM\n\nFirst, you can define an embedding model and LLM in a global settings object. Doing this means you don’t have to specify the models explicitly in the code again.\n\n  * Embedding model: used to generate vector embeddings for the document chunks and the query.\n  * LLM: used to generate an answer based on the user query and the relevant context.\n\n```\nfrom llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingfrom llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAIfrom llama_index.core.settings import SettingsSettings.llm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0.1)Settings.embed_model = OpenAIEmbedding()\n```\n\n## Step 2: Load data\n\nNext, you will create a local directory named `data` in your root directory and download some example data from the [LlamaIndex GitHub repository](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) (MIT license).\n\n```\n!mkdir -p 'data'!wget '<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt>' -O 'data/paul_graham_essay.txt'\n```\n\nAfterward, you can load the data for further processing:\n\n```\nfrom llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader# Load datadocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader( input_files=[\"./data/paul_graham_essay.txt\"]).load_data()\n```\n\n## Step 3: Chunk documents into nodes\n\nAs the entire document is too large to fit into the context window of the LLM, you will need to partition it into smaller text chunks, which are called `Nodes` in LlamaIndex. You can parse the loaded documents into nodes using the `SimpleNodeParser` with a defined chunk size of 1024.\n\n```\nfrom llama_index.core.node_parser import SimpleNodeParsernode_parser = SimpleNodeParser.from_defaults(chunk_size=1024)# Extract nodes from documentsnodes = node_parser.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)\n```\n\n## Step 4: Build index\n\nNext, you will build the index that stores all the external knowledge in [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), an open source vector database.\n\nFirst, you will need to connect to a Weaviate instance. In this case, we’re using [Weaviate Embedded](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded), which allows you to experiment in Notebooks for free without an API key. For a production-ready solution, deploying Weaviate yourself, e.g., [via Docker](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose) or utilizing a [managed service](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/weaviate-cloud-services), is recommended.\n\n```\nimport weaviate# Connect to your Weaviate instanceclient = weaviate.Client( embedded_options=weaviate.embedded.EmbeddedOptions(), )\n```\n\nNext, you will build a `VectorStoreIndex` from the Weaviate client to store your data in and interact with.\n\n```\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContextfrom llama_index.vector_stores.weaviate import WeaviateVectorStoreindex_name = \"MyExternalContext\"# Construct vector storevector_store = WeaviateVectorStore( weaviate_client = client, index_name = index_name)# Set up the storage for the embeddingsstorage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)# Setup the index# build VectorStoreIndex that takes care of chunking documents# and encoding chunks to embeddings for future retrievalindex = VectorStoreIndex( nodes, storage_context = storage_context,)\n```\n\n## Step 5: Setup query engine\n\nLastly, you will set up the index as the query engine.\n\n```\n# The QueryEngine class is equipped with the generator# and facilitates the retrieval and generation stepsquery_engine = index.as_query_engine()\n```\n\n## Step 6: Run a naive RAG query on your data\n\nNow, you can run a naive RAG query on your data, as shown below:\n\n```\n# Run your naive RAG queryresponse = query_engine.query( \"What happened at Interleaf?\")\n```\n\n# Implementing Advanced RAG with LlamaIndex\n\nIn this section, we will cover some simple adjustments you can make to turn the above naive RAG pipeline into an advanced one. This walkthrough will cover the following selection of advanced RAG techniques:\n\n  * [Pre-retrieval optimization: Sentence window retrieval](#c968)\n  * [Retrieval optimization: Hybrid search](#3275)\n  * [Post-retrieval optimization: Re-ranking](#c1e2)\n\n\n\nAs we will only cover the modifications here, you can find the [full end-to-end advanced RAG pipeline in this Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes/blob/main/integrations/llamaindex/retrieval-augmented-generation/advanced_rag.ipynb).\n\n# Indexing optimization example: Sentence window retrieval\n\nFor the [sentence window retrieval technique](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/node_postprocessor/MetadataReplacementDemo.html), you need to make two adjustments: First, you must adjust how you store and post-process your data. Instead of the `SimpleNodeParser`, we will use the `SentenceWindowNodeParser`.\n\n```\nfrom llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceWindowNodeParser# create the sentence window node parser w/ default settingsnode_parser = SentenceWindowNodeParser.from_defaults( window_size=3, window_metadata_key=\"window\", original_text_metadata_key=\"original_text\",)\n```\n\nThe `SentenceWindowNodeParser` does two things:\n\n  1. It separates the document into single sentences, which will be embedded.\n  2. For each sentence, it creates a context window. If you specify a `window_size = 3`, the resulting window will be three sentences long, starting at the previous sentence of the embedded sentence and spanning the sentence after. The window will be stored as metadata.\n\n\n\nDuring retrieval, the sentence that most closely matches the query is returned. After retrieval, you need to replace the sentence with the entire window from the metadata by defining a `MetadataReplacementPostProcessor` and using it in the list of `node_postprocessors`.\n\n```\nfrom llama_index.core.postprocessor import MetadataReplacementPostProcessor# The target key defaults to `window` to match the node_parser's defaultpostproc = MetadataReplacementPostProcessor( target_metadata_key=\"window\")...query_engine = index.as_query_engine( node_postprocessors = [postproc],)\n```\n\n# Retrieval optimization example: Hybrid search\n\nImplementing a hybrid search in LlamaIndex is as easy as two parameter changes to the `query_engine` if the underlying vector database supports hybrid search queries. The `alpha` parameter specifies the weighting between vector search and keyword-based search, where `alpha=0` means keyword-based search and `alpha=1` means pure vector search.\n\n```\nquery_engine = index.as_query_engine( ..., vector_store_query_mode=\"hybrid\", alpha=0.5, ...)\n```\n\n# Post-retrieval optimization example: Re-ranking\n\nAdding a reranker to your advanced RAG pipeline only takes three simple steps:\n\n  1. First, define a reranker model. Here, we are using the `[BAAI/bge-reranker-base](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-base)`[from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-base).\n  2. In the query engine, add the reranker model to the list of `node_postprocessors`.\n  3. Increase the `similarity_top_k` in the query engine to retrieve more context passages, which can be reduced to `top_n` after reranking.\n\n```\n# !pip install torch sentence-transformersfrom llama_index.core.postprocessor import SentenceTransformerRerank# Define reranker modelrerank = SentenceTransformerRerank( top_n = 2, model = \"BAAI/bge-reranker-base\")...# Add reranker to query enginequery_engine = index.as_query_engine( similarity_top_k = 6, ..., node_postprocessors = [rerank], ...,)\n```\n\nThere are many more different techniques within the advanced RAG paradigm.
