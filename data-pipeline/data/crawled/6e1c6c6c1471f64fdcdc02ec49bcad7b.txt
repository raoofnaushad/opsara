By: [Grig Duta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grigduta/), Solution Architect at [Qwak](https://www.qwak.com)

This article serves as a focused guide for data scientists and ML engineers who are looking to transition from experimental machine learning to production-ready MLOps practices. We identify the limitations of traditional ML setups and introduce you to essential MLOps open-source tools that can help you build a more robust, scalable, and maintainable ML system.

The tools discussed include Feast for feature management, MLflow for model tracking and versioning, Seldon for model deployment, Evidently for real-time monitoring, and Kubeflow for workflow orchestration.

# Introduction to Open-Source MLOps

The machine learning landscape is constantly changing, and the transition from model development to production deployment presents its own set of challenges. While Jupyter notebooks and isolated scripts are useful for experimentation, they often lack the features needed for a production-grade system. This article aims to help you navigate these challenges by introducing the concept of MLOps and a selection of open-source tools that can facilitate the creation of a production-ready ML pipeline.

Whether you’re a data scientist looking to transition into production or an ML engineer seeking to optimize your existing workflows, this article aims to provide a focused overview of essential MLOps practices and tools.

# Why Production-Grade ML is Different

**Dynamic vs Static** : Unlike experimental ML, which often uses fixed datasets, production environments are dynamic. They require systems that can adapt to fluctuating user demand and data variability.

**Inelastic Demand** : User requests in production can come at any time, requiring a system that can auto-scale to meet this inelastic demand.

**Data Drift** : Production systems need constant monitoring for changes in data distribution, known as data drift, which can affect model performance.

**Real-Time Needs** : Many production applications require real-time predictions, necessitating low-latency data processing.

# The Traditional Machine Learning Setup

In a traditional machine learning setup, the focus is often on experimentation and proof-of-concept rather than production readiness. The workflow is generally linear and manual, lacking the automation and scalability required for a production environment.

Let’s break down what this traditional setup usually entails, using a Credit Risk prediction model as an example:

  * Data preprocessing and feature engineering are typically done in an ad-hoc manner using tools like Jupyter notebooks. There’s usually no version control for the data transformations or features, making it difficult to reproduce results.
  * The model is trained and validated using the same Jupyter notebook environment. Hyper-parameters are often tuned manually, and the training process lacks systematic tracking of model versions, performance metrics, or experiment metadata.
  * Once the model is trained, predictions are run in batch mode. This is a manual step where the model is applied to a dataset to generate predictions, which are then saved for further analysis or reporting.
  * The prediction results, along with any model artifacts, are manually saved to a data storage service, such as a cloud-based data store. There’s usually no versioning or tracking, making it challenging to manage model updates or rollbacks.



You can picture this setup in the following image.

# The Journey from Notebooks to Production: An Integrated ML System‍

While there’s a wealth of information available on the MLOps lifecycle, this article aims to provide a focused overview that bridges the gap between a model in a Jupyter notebook and a full-fledged, production-grade ML system.

Our primary objective is to delve into how specific open-source tools can be orchestrated to create a robust, production-ready ML setup. Although we won’t be discussing Kubernetes in detail, it’s worth noting that the architecture we explore can be deployed on container orchestrators like Kubernetes for further scalability and robustness.

To ground our discussion, let’s consider a real-world scenario: a data scientist is developing a predictive model for credit risk. The model relies on financial and behavioral data, which is housed in a Snowflake database but could just as easily reside in other data sources.

The following diagram illustrates an integrated ML system capable of real-time predictions. The subsequent sections will guide you through the transformation from a traditional ML setup to this more integrated, streamlined system. To achieve this, we’ll introduce you to the top 5 open-source tools that are making waves in the industry today.

In the next sections, we’ll explore the five most important MLops Open-Source Tool categories:

# 1. Data Management and Feature Engineering

Managing and engineering features for machine learning models is a critical step that often determines the quality of the model. A feature store serves as a centralized hub for these features, ensuring that they are consistently managed, stored, and served.

## What is a Feature Store?

[A feature store](https://www.qwak.com/post/what-is-a-feature-store-in-ml) is a centralized repository that acts as a bridge between raw data and machine learning models. It streamlines the feature engineering process and ensures consistency across different models. Feature stores can be broadly categorized into two types:

  * Offline Feature Store — is primarily used for batch processing of features. It’s where you store historical feature data that can be used for training machine learning models. The offline store is optimized for analytical workloads, allowing you to query large volumes of data efficiently. Typically, the offline feature store is backed by a data warehouse or a distributed file system like S3.
  * Online Feature Store — serves features in real-time for model inference. When a prediction request comes in, the online feature store quickly retrieves the relevant features to be fed into the model. This is crucial for applications that require low-latency predictions. Online feature stores are often backed by high-performance databases like Redis to ensure quick data retrieval.



## Additional Considerations When Adopting an Open Source Feature Store Solution

  * Data Processing Infrastructure: Open source feature store solutions usually serve as an abstraction layer that integrates with your existing data infrastructure. For batch feature computation, tasks can be offloaded to an Apache Spark cluster, while real-time feature computation can be handled by a Kafka Streams application or Apache Spark Structured Streaming.
  * Offline and Online Storage: Depending on the solution, you might need to set up and manage separate storage systems for both offline and online stores. The choice of storage systems should align with your workload requirements and existing infrastructure.

# 3. Model Deployment and Serving

After training and registering your ML model, the next critical step is deployment. While batch predictions are often executed offline where latency is less critical, real-time predictions demand low-latency responses to HTTP requests. Without deployment, an ML model remains just a theoretical construct; it’s the deployment that brings it to life in a real-world context.

## Model Deployment

In the journey of a machine learning model from development to real-world application, model deployment plays a critical role. This process involves integrating the trained model into a production environment, enabling it to make predictions or analyses based on new data. The deployment phase is increasingly streamlined with the integration of [Machine Learning CI/CD pipelines](https://www.qwak.com/post/ci-cd-pipelines-for-machine-learning). These practices automate crucial steps like testing, dependency management, and the actual deployment of the model, ensuring a smooth, reliable transition to a live environment.

## Model Serving

Model serving is about making the deployed model accessible for practical use, typically through a web service. It involves setting up an infrastructure that receives incoming data requests, processes them through the model, and returns predictions. This can range from real-time predictions needed in instant decision-making scenarios to batch processing for larger datasets. Open-source model serving tools are designed to simplify this process. They offer features like handling multiple requests simultaneously, efficiently managing the load, and ensuring the model performs optimally under various operational conditions. These tools are crucial in operationalizing machine learning models, making them an integral part of the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

## Additional Considerations When Adopting Model Serving Tools

  * Container Orchestration Infrastructure: Before choosing a model serving tool, it’s crucial to have a robust container orchestration infrastructure in place. This includes setting up and configuring platforms like Kubernetes to ensure smooth deployment and scaling of models.
  * Infrastructure Autoscaling: Prior to selecting a serving tool, assess your infrastructure’s ability to autoscale resources based on demand. Integration with auto-scaling services, especially in cloud environments, should be considered to optimize resource usage.

While open-source tools offer flexibility and community support, they often come with the operational burden of setup, maintenance, and integration. One often overlooked aspect is the need for Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) skills within the organization to effectively utilize these tools. Additionally, the time required for full deployment of these open-source solutions can range from 3 to 6 months, a period during which models may be held back from production, affecting business objectives.If you’re looking for an alternative that combines the best of both worlds, managed [MLOps platforms](https://www.qwak.com/post/top-mlops-end-to-end) are worth considering.

One such platform is [Qwak](https://www.qwak.com/), which aims to simplify the MLOps lifecycle by offering an integrated suite of features. From feature management to model deployment and monitoring, Qwak provides a unified solution that can be deployed either as a SaaS or on your own cloud infrastructure. This allows you to focus more on model development and business impact, rather than the intricacies of tool management.

# Conclusion‍

The transition from experimental machine learning to production-grade MLOps is a complex but necessary journey for organizations aiming to leverage ML at scale. While traditional setups may suffice for isolated experiments, they lack the robustness and scalability required for production environments. Open-source MLOps tools like [Feast](https://feast.dev/), [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/), [Seldon](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core), and others offer valuable capabilities but come with their own set of challenges, including operational overhead and integration complexities.

Managed MLOps platforms like [Qwak](https://www.qwak.com/) offer a compelling alternative, providing an integrated, hassle-free experience that allows teams to focus on what truly matters: building impactful machine learning models. Whether you’re a data scientist looking to make the leap into production or an ML engineer aiming to streamline your workflows, the landscape of MLOps tools and practices is rich and varied, offering something for everyone.

By understanding the limitations of traditional setups and exploring both open-source and managed MLOps solutions, you can make informed decisions that best suit your organization’s needs and take a significant step towards operationalizing machine learning effectively.
