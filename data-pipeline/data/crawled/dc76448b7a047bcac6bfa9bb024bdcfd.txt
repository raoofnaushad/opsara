[Start Course](https://lightning.ai/pages/courses/deep-learning-fundamentals/unit-1/unit-1-1/)

## Welcome to Deep Learning Fundamentals

Deep Learning Fundamentals is a free course on learning deep learning using a modern open-source stack.

If you found this page, you probably heard that artificial intelligence and deep learning are taking the world by storm. This is correct. In this course, [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/), a best-selling author and professor, will teach you deep learning (machine learning with deep learning) from the ground up via a course of 10 units with bite-sized videos, quizzes, and exercises. The entire course is free and uses the most popular open-source tools for deep learning.

**What will you learn in this course?**

  * What machine learning is and when to use it
  * The main concepts of deep learning
  * How to design deep learning experiments with PyTorch
  * How to write efficient deep learning code with PyTorch Lightning



**What will you be able to do after this course?**

  * Build classifiers for various kinds of data like tables, images, and text
  * Tune models effectively to optimize predictive and computational performance



**How is this course structured?**

  * The course consists of 10 units, each containing several subsections
  * It is centered around informative, succinct videos that are respectful of your time
  * In each unit, you will find optional exercises to practice your knowledge
  * We also provide additional resources for those who want a deep dive on specific topics



**What are the prerequisites?**

  * Ideally, you should already be familiar with programming in Python
  * (Some lectures will involve a tiny bit of math, but a strong math background is not required!)



**Are there interactive quizzes or exercises?**

  * Each section is accompanied by optional multiple-choice quizzes to test your understanding of the material
  * Optionally, each unit also features one or more code exercises to practice implementing concepts covered in this class



**Is there a course completion badge or certificate?**

  * At the end of this course, you can take an optional exam featuring 25 multiple-choice questions
  * Upon answering 80% of the questions in the exam correctly (there are 5 attempts), you obtain an optional course completion badge that can be shared on LinkedIn
