###### Sweeps at scale

"Lightning AI transformed our model fitting process. We fit 1000 models in only two weeks. At our scale, this would have taken months without Lightning AI."

![](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/homepage/columbia.svg)

###### Matt, Lead Researcher

###### The Paninski Lab, Columbia University

###### Reduce infra setup by 93%

"Lightning reduced our infrastructure setup time by 93%, from 30 days to just 2. It allowed us to focus on developing and deploying AI instead of infrastructure."

![](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/app-2/cisco-logo.svg)

###### Mark

###### Cisco - armorblox

###### Awesome for JAX development

"It’s like developing in VSCode on your laptop, but with free cloud CPUs and persistent state. Parallelizing JAX runs is way simpler than other platforms I’ve tried!"

![](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/app-2/google.png)

###### Kevin Murphy, AI Researcher

###### Google

###### Prototype 6× faster

"Instead of taking 36 hours to know if this model works, we knew by the end of the day."

![](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/homepage/mit.svg)

###### Sam, Researcher

###### MIT Sustainable Design Lab

###### Debug together

"When it came time for our experts to collaborate on common experiments we ran into the “it works on my machine” problem. With Lightning, we saved hours per week."

![](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/homepage/earthdaily.jpg)

###### Robin, Researcher

###### EarthDaily Analytics

###### My VSCode IDE on the cloud

"My workflow was drastically simplified. I get all the native VS code plugins in the web browser, with all my dependencies, my code, my compute in one spot. It all just works."

###### Frances, CEO

###### Lexset

###### Feels local, but on the cloud

"My computer on the cloud. It's like working on my local machine but using the computing power of Lightning."

![](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/homepage/bordeaux.png)

###### Majd, Researcher

###### Bordeaux Bioinformatics

###### Change GPUs in seconds

"The experience of changing from CPU to GPU was mindblowing. It’s extremely quick and I didn’t even need to think about copying or mounting my files."

![](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/homepage/user.png)

###### Irina, ML Engineer

###### Lightning User

###### Experiment at lightning speed

"We validated our hypothesis in just 4 weeks for under $10k. It would've taken us at least 70% longer if we did not have the Lightning platform!"

![](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/homepage/octai.jpg)

###### Malcolm, co-founder

###### GenreX

###### No environment setup

"The environment management is so much better with Lightning AI; like an environment already provisioned for a workspace is a really good model."
