Email Print\n\nTable of contents\n\n# Machine Learning operations maturity model\n\nAzure Machine Learning \n\nThe purpose of this maturity model is to help clarify the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) principles and practices. The maturity model shows the continuous improvement in the creation and operation of a production level machine learning application environment. You can use it as a metric for establishing the progressive requirements needed to measure the maturity of a machine learning production environment and its associated processes.\n\n[](#maturity-model)\n\n## Maturity model\n\nThe MLOps maturity model helps clarify the Development Operations (DevOps) principles and practices necessary to run a successful MLOps environment. It's intended to identify gaps in an existing organization's attempt to implement such an environment. It's also a way to show you how to grow your MLOps capability in increments rather than overwhelm you with the requirements of a fully mature environment. Use it as a guide to:\n\n  * Estimate the scope of the work for new engagements.\n\n  * Establish realistic success criteria.\n\n  * Identify deliverables you'll hand over at the conclusion of the engagement.\n\n\n\n\nAs with most maturity models, the MLOps maturity model qualitatively assesses people/culture, processes/structures, and objects/technology. As the maturity level increases, the probability increases that incidents or errors will lead to improvements in the quality of the development and production processes.\n\nThe MLOps maturity model encompasses five levels of technical capability:\n\nExpand table\n\nLevel | Description | Highlights | Technology  \n---|---|---|---  \n0 | [No MLOps](#level-0-no-mlops) | \n\n  * Difficult to manage full machine learning model lifecycle\n  * The teams are disparate and releases are painful\n  * Most systems exist as \"black boxes,\" little feedback during/post deployment\n\n| \n\n  * Manual builds and deployments\n  * Manual testing of model and application\n  * No centralized tracking of model performance\n  * Training of model is manual\n\n  \n1 | [DevOps but no MLOps](#level-1-devops-no-mlops) | \n\n  * Releases are less painful than No MLOps, but rely on Data Team for every new model\n  * Still limited feedback on how well a model performs in production\n  * Difficult to trace/reproduce results\n\n| \n\n  * Automated builds\n  * Automated tests for application code\n\n  \n2 | [Automated Training](#level-2-automated-training) | \n\n  * Training environment is fully managed and traceable\n  * Easy to reproduce model\n  * Releases are manual, but low friction\n\n| \n\n  * Automated model training\n  * Centralized tracking of model training performance\n  * Model management\n\n  \n3 | [Automated Model Deployment](#level-3-automated-model-deployment) | \n\n  * Releases are low friction and automatic\n  * Full traceability from deployment back to original data\n  * Entire environment managed: train > test > production \n\n| \n\n  * Integrated A/B testing of model performance for deployment\n  * Automated tests for all code\n  * Centralized tracking of model training performance\n\n  \n4 | [Full MLOps Automated Operations](#level-4-full-mlops-automated-retraining) | \n\n  * Full system automated and easily monitored\n  * Production systems are providing information on how to improve and, in some cases, automatically improve with new models\n  * Approaching a zero-downtime system \n\n| \n\n  * Automated model training and testing\n  * Verbose, centralized metrics from deployed model\n\n  \n  \nThe tables that follow identify the detailed characteristics for that level of process maturity.
