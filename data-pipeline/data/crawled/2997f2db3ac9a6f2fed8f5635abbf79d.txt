* Make CLI lazy load
This will allow parameters to be added when processing the `start` step
\(for the upcomming config change\).
* Try to fix tests
* Support lazy CLI in runner
* Stub fixes
* Change top-level flow decorator options to be prefixed by METAFLOW_FLOW_
Previously, options like `branch` and `name` \(injected by the project
decorator for example\) could be set using `METAFLOW_BRANCH`. They now
need to be set using `METAFLOW_FLOW_BRANCH`.
This change is made to prevent clashes between regular metaflow
configuration settings and decorator level options.
No other changes are made so `METAFLOW_RUN_MAX_WORKERS` still works
as expected and `METAFLOW_PYLINT` as well.
* Initial Config object
* Move from --<configname> <config> to --config <configname> <config>
* Fix runner use of configs
* Multiple fix plus sample flow
Several fixes:
 - fixed an issue with default values
 - better handling of parameter defaults as configs
 - handle config defaults as functions
 - ConfigValue is more "dict"-like
 - made <myflow>.configs and <myflow>.steps work properly
 - renamed resolve_configs to init
* Addressed comments. Added more documentation/explanation
Specifically:
 - moved things out of the INFO file
 - added to_dict
 - renamed user_configs to config_parameters
* Added test, more cleanup
Specifically:
 - made config values immutable
 - cleaned up state stored in FlowSpec
 - added a test exercising configs in various places
* Fixup conda decorator
* Fix parallel tests
* Fix current singleton test \(conflict with `steps`\)
* Call decorator init method on non-static decorators
* Several fixes
 - Separate out value and file \(so default and default_value and --config and --config-value\)
 - Provide classes for step and flow config decorators with proxy objects
 - Split things into several files \(it was getting too long\)
 - Addressed all bugs discussed
* Better handling of default options
* Changed names
* Fix includefile
* Remove more old code
* Bug fixes and better Custom*Decorator behavior.
Fixed some typos and updated test to reflect latest code.
Fixed a few other issues:
 - fixed an issue where a config was used in different decorators
  causing it to produce an incorrect access string
 - made the decorators work with or without arguments
* do not map config parameters to CLI command for argo/step functions
* Added string parsers. Added test for mutable flow/step. Added debug messages
Use METAFLOW_DEBUG_USERCONF=1 to get a bit more detail.
Should be feature complete now.

* Reset cached parameters properly
* Updated tests
* More tests and a few tweaks

* Make CLI lazy load
This will allow parameters to be added when processing the `start` step
\(for the upcomming config change\).
* Try to fix tests
* Support lazy CLI in runner
* Stub fixes
* Change top-level flow decorator options to be prefixed by METAFLOW_FLOW_
Previously, options like `branch` and `name` \(injected by the project
decorator for example\) could be set using `METAFLOW_BRANCH`. They now
need to be set using `METAFLOW_FLOW_BRANCH`.
This change is made to prevent clashes between regular metaflow
configuration settings and decorator level options.
No other changes are made so `METAFLOW_RUN_MAX_WORKERS` still works
as expected and `METAFLOW_PYLINT` as well.
* Initial Config object
* Move from --<configname> <config> to --config <configname> <config>
* Fix runner use of configs
* Multiple fix plus sample flow
Several fixes:
 - fixed an issue with default values
 - better handling of parameter defaults as configs
 - handle config defaults as functions
 - ConfigValue is more "dict"-like
 - made <myflow>.configs and <myflow>.steps work properly
 - renamed resolve_configs to init
* Addressed comments. Added more documentation/explanation
Specifically:
 - moved things out of the INFO file
 - added to_dict
 - renamed user_configs to config_parameters
* Added test, more cleanup
Specifically:
 - made config values immutable
 - cleaned up state stored in FlowSpec
 - added a test exercising configs in various places
* Fixup conda decorator
* Fix parallel tests
* Fix current singleton test \(conflict with `steps`\)
* Call decorator init method on non-static decorators

# Metaflow

[](#metaflow)

Metaflow is a human-friendly library that helps scientists and engineers build and manage real-life data science projects. Metaflow was [originally developed at Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-metaflow-a-human-centric-framework-for-data-science-fa72e04a5d9) to boost productivity of data scientists who work on a wide variety of projects from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning.

For more information, see [Metaflow's website](https://metaflow.org) and [documentation](https://docs.metaflow.org).

## From prototype to production (and back)

[](#from-prototype-to-production-and-back)

Metaflow provides a simple, friendly API that covers foundational needs of ML, AI, and data science projects: [![](/Netflix/metaflow/raw/master/docs/prototype-to-prod.png)](/Netflix/metaflow/blob/master/docs/prototype-to-prod.png)

  1. [Rapid local prototyping](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics), [support for notebooks](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/visualizing-results), and [built-in experiment tracking and versioning](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/client).
  2. [Horizontal and vertical scalability to the cloud](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction), utilizing both CPUs and GPUs, and [fast data access](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/data).
  3. [Managing dependencies](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/dependencies) and [one-click deployments to highly available production orchestrators](https://docs.metaflow.org/production/introduction).



## Getting started

[](#getting-started)

Getting up and running is easy. If you don't know where to start, [Metaflow sandbox](https://outerbounds.com/sandbox) will have you running and exploring Metaflow in seconds.

### Installing Metaflow in your Python environment

[](#installing-metaflow-in-your-python-environment)

To install Metaflow in your local environment, you can install from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/metaflow/):

```
pip install metaflow
```

Alternatively, you can also install from [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/metaflow):

```
conda install -c conda-forge metaflow
```

If you are eager to try out Metaflow in practice, you can start with the [tutorial](https://docs.metaflow.org/getting-started/tutorials). After the tutorial, you can learn more about how Metaflow works [here](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics).

### Deploying infrastructure for Metaflow in your cloud

[](#deploying-infrastructure-for-metaflow-in-your-cloud)

[![](/Netflix/metaflow/raw/master/docs/multicloud.png)](/Netflix/metaflow/blob/master/docs/multicloud.png)

While you can get started with Metaflow easily on your laptop, the main benefits of Metaflow lie in its ability to [scale out to external compute clusters](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction) and to [deploy to production-grade workflow orchestrators](https://docs.metaflow.org/production/introduction). To benefit from these features, follow this [guide](https://outerbounds.com/engineering/welcome/) to configure Metaflow and the infrastructure behind it appropriately.
