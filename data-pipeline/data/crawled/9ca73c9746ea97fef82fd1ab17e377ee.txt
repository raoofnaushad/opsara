**PyG** _(PyTorch Geometric)_ is a library built upon [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for a wide range of applications related to structured data.

It consists of various methods for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures, also known as _[geometric deep learning](http://geometricdeeplearning.com/)_ , from a variety of published papers. In addition, it consists of easy-to-use mini-batch loaders for operating on many small and single giant graphs, [multi GPU-support](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/examples/multi_gpu), [`torch.compile`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/compile.html) support, [`DataPipe`](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/datapipe.py) support, a large number of common benchmark datasets (based on simple interfaces to create your own), and helpful transforms, both for learning on arbitrary graphs as well as on 3D meshes or point clouds.

## Library Highlights

[](#library-highlights)

Whether you are a machine learning researcher or first-time user of machine learning toolkits, here are some reasons to try out PyG for machine learning on graph-structured data.

  * **Easy-to-use and unified API** : All it takes is 10-20 lines of code to get started with training a GNN model (see the next section for a [quick tour](#quick-tour-for-new-users)). PyG is _PyTorch-on-the-rocks_ : It utilizes a tensor-centric API and keeps design principles close to vanilla PyTorch. If you are already familiar with PyTorch, utilizing PyG is straightforward.
  * **Comprehensive and well-maintained GNN models** : Most of the state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network architectures have been implemented by library developers or authors of research papers and are ready to be applied.
  * **Great flexibility** : Existing PyG models can easily be extended for conducting your own research with GNNs. Making modifications to existing models or creating new architectures is simple, thanks to its easy-to-use message passing API, and a variety of operators and utility functions.
  * **Large-scale real-world GNN models** : We focus on the need of GNN applications in challenging real-world scenarios, and support learning on diverse types of graphs, including but not limited to: scalable GNNs for graphs with millions of nodes; dynamic GNNs for node predictions over time; heterogeneous GNNs with multiple node types and edge types.



## Quick Tour for New Users

[](#quick-tour-for-new-users)

In this quick tour, we highlight the ease of creating and training a GNN model with only a few lines of code.

### Train your own GNN model

[](#train-your-own-gnn-model)

In the first glimpse of PyG, we implement the training of a GNN for classifying papers in a citation graph. For this, we load the [Cora](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.Planetoid.html) dataset, and create a simple 2-layer GCN model using the pre-defined [`GCNConv`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.GCNConv.html):

```
import torch from torch import Tensor from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv from torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid dataset = Planetoid(root='.', name='Cora') class GCN(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels): super().__init__() self.conv1 = GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels) self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, out_channels) def forward(self, x: Tensor, edge_index: Tensor) -> Tensor: # x: Node feature matrix of shape [num_nodes, in_channels] # edge_index: Graph connectivity matrix of shape [2, num_edges] x = self.conv1(x, edge_index).relu() x = self.conv2(x, edge_index) return x model = GCN(dataset.num_features, 16, dataset.num_classes)
```

We can now optimize the model in a training loop, similar to the [standard PyTorch training procedure](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/optimization_tutorial.html#full-implementation).

```
import torch.nn.functional as F data = dataset[0] optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) for epoch in range(200): pred = model(data.x, data.edge_index) loss = F.cross_entropy(pred[data.train_mask], data.y[data.train_mask]) # Backpropagation optimizer.zero_grad() loss.backward() optimizer.step()
```

More information about evaluating final model performance can be found in the corresponding [example](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/gcn.py).

### Create your own GNN layer

[](#create-your-own-gnn-layer)

In addition to the easy application of existing GNNs, PyG makes it simple to implement custom Graph Neural Networks (see [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/create_gnn.html) for the accompanying tutorial). For example, this is all it takes to implement the [edge convolutional layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07829) from Wang _et al._ :

x i ′ = max j ∈ N ( i ) MLP θ ( [ x i , x j − x i ] )

```
import torch from torch import Tensor from torch.nn import Sequential, Linear, ReLU from torch_geometric.nn import MessagePassing class EdgeConv(MessagePassing): def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels): super().__init__(aggr="max") # "Max" aggregation. self.mlp = Sequential( Linear(2 * in_channels, out_channels), ReLU(), Linear(out_channels, out_channels), ) def forward(self, x: Tensor, edge_index: Tensor) -> Tensor: # x: Node feature matrix of shape [num_nodes, in_channels] # edge_index: Graph connectivity matrix of shape [2, num_edges] return self.propagate(edge_index, x=x) # shape [num_nodes, out_channels] def message(self, x_j: Tensor, x_i: Tensor) -> Tensor: # x_j: Source node features of shape [num_edges, in_channels] # x_i: Target node features of shape [num_edges, in_channels] edge_features = torch.cat([x_i, x_j - x_i], dim=-1) return self.mlp(edge_features) # shape [num_edges, out_channels]
```

## Architecture Overview

[](#architecture-overview)

PyG provides a multi-layer framework that enables users to build Graph Neural Network solutions on both low and high levels. It comprises of the following components:

  * The PyG **engine** utilizes the powerful PyTorch deep learning framework with full [`torch.compile`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/compile.html) and [TorchScript](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/jit.html) support, as well as additions of efficient CPU/CUDA libraries for operating on sparse data, _e.g._ , [`pyg-lib`](https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib).
  * The PyG **storage** handles data processing, transformation and loading pipelines. It is capable of handling and processing large-scale graph datasets, and provides effective solutions for heterogeneous graphs. It further provides a variety of sampling solutions, which enable training of GNNs on large-scale graphs.
  * The PyG **operators** bundle essential functionalities for implementing Graph Neural Networks. PyG supports important GNN building blocks that can be combined and applied to various parts of a GNN model, ensuring rich flexibility of GNN design.
  * Finally, PyG provides an abundant set of GNN **models** , and examples that showcase GNN models on standard graph benchmarks. Thanks to its flexibility, users can easily build and modify custom GNN models to fit their specific needs.

## Implemented GNN Models

[](#implemented-gnn-models)

We list currently supported PyG models, layers and operators according to category:

**GNN layers:** All Graph Neural Network layers are implemented via the **[`nn.MessagePassing`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.MessagePassing.html)** interface. A GNN layer specifies how to perform message passing, _i.e._ by designing different message, aggregation and update functions as defined [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/create_gnn.html). These GNN layers can be stacked together to create Graph Neural Network models.

**Scalable GNNs:** PyG supports the implementation of Graph Neural Networks that can scale to large-scale graphs. Such application is challenging since the entire graph, its associated features and the GNN parameters cannot fit into GPU memory. Many state-of-the-art scalability approaches tackle this challenge by sampling neighborhoods for mini-batch training, graph clustering and partitioning, or by using simplified GNN models. These approaches have been implemented in PyG, and can benefit from the above GNN layers, operators and models.

## Installation

[](#installation)

PyG is available for Python 3.9 to Python 3.12.

### Anaconda

[](#anaconda)

You can now install PyG via [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/pyg/pyg) for all major OS/PyTorch/CUDA combinations 🤗 If you have not yet installed PyTorch, install it via `conda` as described in the [official PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Given that you have PyTorch installed (`>=1.8.0`), simply run

```
`conda install pyg -c pyg `
```

### PyPi

[](#pypi)

From **PyG 2.3** onwards, you can install and use PyG **without any external library** required except for PyTorch. For this, simply run

```
`pip install torch_geometric `
```

### Additional Libraries

[](#additional-libraries)

If you want to utilize the full set of features from PyG, there exists several additional libraries you may want to install:

  * **[`pyg-lib`](https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib)** : Heterogeneous GNN operators and graph sampling routines
  * **[`torch-scatter`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter)** : Accelerated and efficient sparse reductions
  * **[`torch-sparse`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_sparse)** : [`SparseTensor`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/sparse_tensor.html) support
  * **[`torch-cluster`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_cluster)** : Graph clustering routines
  * **[`torch-spline-conv`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_spline_conv)** : [`SplineConv`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.SplineConv.html) support



These packages come with their own CPU and GPU kernel implementations based on the [PyTorch C++/CUDA/hip(ROCm) extension interface](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp). For a basic usage of PyG, these dependencies are **fully optional**. We recommend to start with a minimal installation, and install additional dependencies once you start to actually need them.

For ease of installation of these extensions, we provide `pip` wheels for all major OS/PyTorch/CUDA combinations, see [here](https://data.pyg.org/whl).

#### PyTorch 2.5

[](#pytorch-25)
