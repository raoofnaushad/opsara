# ‚ö°Ô∏è What is FastEmbed?

[](#Ô∏è-what-is-fastembed)

FastEmbed is a lightweight, fast, Python library built for embedding generation. We [support popular text models](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/). Please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/issues/new) if you want us to add a new model.

The default text embedding (`TextEmbedding`) model is Flag Embedding, presented in the [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) leaderboard. It supports "query" and "passage" prefixes for the input text. Here is an example for [Retrieval Embedding Generation](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/qdrant/Retrieval_with_FastEmbed/) and how to use [FastEmbed with Qdrant](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/qdrant/Usage_With_Qdrant/).

## üìà Why FastEmbed?

[](#-why-fastembed)

  1. Light: FastEmbed is a lightweight library with few external dependencies. We don't require a GPU and don't download GBs of PyTorch dependencies, and instead use the ONNX Runtime. This makes it a great candidate for serverless runtimes like AWS Lambda.

  2. Fast: FastEmbed is designed for speed. We use the ONNX Runtime, which is faster than PyTorch. We also use data parallelism for encoding large datasets.

  3. Accurate: FastEmbed is better than OpenAI Ada-002. We also [support](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/) an ever-expanding set of models, including a few multilingual models.




## üöÄ Installation

[](#-installation)

To install the FastEmbed library, pip works best. You can install it with or without GPU support:

```
pip install fastembed # or with GPU support pip install fastembed-gpu
```

## üìñ Quickstart

[](#-quickstart)

```
from fastembed import TextEmbedding # Example list of documents documents: list[str] = [ "This is built to be faster and lighter than other embedding libraries e.g. Transformers, Sentence-Transformers, etc.", "fastembed is supported by and maintained by Qdrant.", ] # This will trigger the model download and initialization embedding_model = TextEmbedding() print("The model BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 is ready to use.") embeddings_generator = embedding_model.embed(documents) # reminder this is a generator embeddings_list = list(embedding_model.embed(documents)) # you can also convert the generator to a list, and that to a numpy array len(embeddings_list[0]) # Vector of 384 dimensions
```

Fastembed supports a variety of models for different tasks and modalities. The list of all the available models can be found [here](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/)

### üéí Dense text embeddings

[](#-dense-text-embeddings)

```
from fastembed import TextEmbedding model = TextEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5") embeddings = list(model.embed(documents)) # [ # array([-0.1115, 0.0097, 0.0052, 0.0195, ...], dtype=float32), # array([-0.1019, 0.0635, -0.0332, 0.0522, ...], dtype=float32) # ]
```

### üî± Sparse text embeddings

[](#-sparse-text-embeddings)

  * SPLADE++



```
from fastembed import SparseTextEmbedding model = SparseTextEmbedding(model_name="prithivida/Splade_PP_en_v1") embeddings = list(model.embed(documents)) # [ # SparseEmbedding(indices=[ 17, 123, 919, ... ], values=[0.71, 0.22, 0.39, ...]), # SparseEmbedding(indices=[ 38, 12, 91, ... ], values=[0.11, 0.22, 0.39, ...]) # ]
```

### ü¶• Late interaction models (aka ColBERT)

[](#-late-interaction-models-aka-colbert)

```
from fastembed import LateInteractionTextEmbedding model = LateInteractionTextEmbedding(model_name="colbert-ir/colbertv2.0") embeddings = list(model.embed(documents)) # [ # array([ # [-0.1115, 0.0097, 0.0052, 0.0195, ...], # [-0.1019, 0.0635, -0.0332, 0.0522, ...], # ]), # array([ # [-0.9019, 0.0335, -0.0032, 0.0991, ...], # [-0.2115, 0.8097, 0.1052, 0.0195, ...], # ]),  # ]
```

### üñºÔ∏è Image embeddings

[](#Ô∏è-image-embeddings)

```
from fastembed import ImageEmbedding images = [ "./path/to/image1.jpg", "./path/to/image2.jpg", ] model = ImageEmbedding(model_name="Qdrant/clip-ViT-B-32-vision") embeddings = list(model.embed(images)) # [ # array([-0.1115, 0.0097, 0.0052, 0.0195, ...], dtype=float32), # array([-0.1019, 0.0635, -0.0332, 0.0522, ...], dtype=float32) # ]
```

### üîÑ Rerankers

[](#-rerankers)

```
from fastembed.rerank.cross_encoder import TextCrossEncoder query = "Who is maintaining Qdrant?" documents: list[str] = [ "This is built to be faster and lighter than other embedding libraries e.g. Transformers, Sentence-Transformers, etc.", "fastembed is supported by and maintained by Qdrant.", ] encoder = TextCrossEncoder(model_name="Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2") scores = list(encoder.rerank(query, documents)) # [-11.48061752319336, 5.472434997558594]
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è FastEmbed on a GPU

[](#Ô∏è-fastembed-on-a-gpu)

FastEmbed supports running on GPU devices. It requires installation of the `fastembed-gpu` package.

```
pip install fastembed-gpu
```

Check our [example](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/FastEmbed_GPU/) for detailed instructions, CUDA 12.x support and troubleshooting of the common issues.

```
from fastembed import TextEmbedding embedding_model = TextEmbedding( model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5", providers=["CUDAExecutionProvider"] ) print("The model BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 is ready to use on a GPU.")
```

## Usage with Qdrant

[](#usage-with-qdrant)

Installation with Qdrant Client in Python:

```
pip install qdrant-client[fastembed]
```

or

```
pip install qdrant-client[fastembed-gpu]
```

You might have to use quotes `pip install 'qdrant-client[fastembed]'` on zsh.

```
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient # Initialize the client client = QdrantClient("localhost", port=6333) # For production # client = QdrantClient(":memory:") # For small experiments # Prepare your documents, metadata, and IDs docs = ["Qdrant has Langchain integrations", "Qdrant also has Llama Index integrations"] metadata = [ {"source": "Langchain-docs"}, {"source": "Llama-index-docs"}, ] ids = [42, 2] # If you want to change the model: # client.set_model("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2") # List of supported models: https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models # Use the new add() instead of upsert() # This internally calls embed() of the configured embedding model client.add( collection_name="demo_collection", documents=docs, metadata=metadata, ids=ids ) search_result = client.query( collection_name="demo_collection", query_text="This is a query document" ) print(search_result)
```
