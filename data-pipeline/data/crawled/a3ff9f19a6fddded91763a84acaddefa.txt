**Camelot** is a Python library that can help you extract tables from PDFs.

**Extract tables from PDFs in just a few lines of code:**

Try it yourself in our interactive quickstart notebook. [![image](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/96889048f8a9014fdeba2a891f97150c6aac6e723f5190236b10215a97ed41f3/68747470733a2f2f636f6c61622e72657365617263682e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f6173736574732f636f6c61622d62616467652e737667)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camelot-dev/camelot/blob/master/examples/camelot-quickstart-notebook.ipynb)

Or check out a simple example using [this pdf](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/blob/main/docs/_static/pdf/foo.pdf).

```
>>> import camelot >>> tables = camelot.read_pdf('foo.pdf') >>> tables <TableList n=1> >>> tables.export('foo.csv', f='csv', compress=True) # json, excel, html, markdown, sqlite >>> tables[0] <Table shape=(7, 7)> >>> tables[0].parsing_report { 'accuracy': 99.02, 'whitespace': 12.24, 'order': 1, 'page': 1 } >>> tables[0].to_csv('foo.csv') # to_json, to_excel, to_html, to_markdown, to_sqlite >>> tables[0].df # get a pandas DataFrame!

Camelot also comes packaged with a [command-line interface](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cli.html)!

Refer to the [QuickStart Guide](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/blob/main/docs/user/quickstart.rst#quickstart) to quickly get started with Camelot, extract tables from PDFs and explore some basic options.

**Tip:** Visit the `parser-comparison-notebook` to get an overview of all the packed parsers and their features.

**Note:** Camelot only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula [explains](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula#why-tabula), "If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based".)

You can check out some frequently asked questions [here](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/faq.html).

## Why Camelot?

[](#why-camelot)

  * **Configurability** : Camelot gives you control over the table extraction process with [tweakable settings](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced.html).
  * **Metrics** : You can discard bad tables based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without having to manually look at each table.
  * **Output** : Each table is extracted into a **pandas DataFrame** , which seamlessly integrates into [ETL and data analysis workflows](https://gist.github.com/vinayak-mehta/e5949f7c2410a0e12f25d3682dc9e873). You can also export tables to multiple formats, which include CSV, JSON, Excel, HTML, Markdown, and Sqlite.
