It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.\n\n# Quick Start\n\n[](#quick-start)\n\nHere's an HTML document I'll be using as an example throughout this document. It's part of a story from `Alice in Wonderland`::\n\n```\n`html_doc = \"\"\" <html><head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head> <body> <p class=\"title\"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p> <p class=\"story\">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were <a href=\"http://example.com/elsie\" class=\"sister\" id=\"link1\">Elsie</a>, <a href=\"http://example.com/lacie\" class=\"sister\" id=\"link2\">Lacie</a> and <a href=\"http://example.com/tillie\" class=\"sister\" id=\"link3\">Tillie</a>; and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p> <p class=\"story\">...</p> \"\"\" `\n```\n\nRunning the \"three sisters\" document through Beautiful Soup gives us a `BeautifulSoup` object, which represents the document as a nested data structure::\n\n```\n`from bs4 import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc) print(soup.prettify()) # <html> # <head> # <title> # The Dormouse's story # </title> # </head> # <body> # <p class=\"title\"> # <b> # The Dormouse's story # </b> # </p> # <p class=\"story\"> # Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were # <a class=\"sister\" href=\"http://example.com/elsie\" id=\"link1\"> # Elsie # </a> # , # <a class=\"sister\" href=\"http://example.com/lacie\" id=\"link2\"> # Lacie # </a> # and # <a class=\"sister\" href=\"http://example.com/tillie\" id=\"link2\"> # Tillie # </a> # ; and they lived at the bottom of a well. # </p> # <p class=\"story\"> # ... # </p> # </body> # </html> `\n```\n\nHere are some simple ways to navigate that data structure::\n\n```\n`soup.title # <title>The Dormouse's story</title> soup.title.name # u'title' soup.title.string # u'The Dormouse's story' soup.title.parent.name # u'head' soup.p # <p class=\"title\"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p> soup.p['class'] # u'title' soup.a # <a class=\"sister\" href=\"http://example.com/elsie\" id=\"link1\">Elsie</a> soup.find_all('a') # [<a class=\"sister\" href=\"http://example.com/elsie\" id=\"link1\">Elsie</a>, # <a class=\"sister\" href=\"http://example.com/lacie\" id=\"link2\">Lacie</a>, # <a class=\"sister\" href=\"http://example.com/tillie\" id=\"link3\">Tillie</a>] soup.find(id=\"link3\") # <a class=\"sister\" href=\"http://example.com/tillie\" id=\"link3\">Tillie</a> `\n```\n\nOne common task is extracting all the URLs found within a page's tags::\n\n```\n`for link in soup.find_all('a'): print(link.get('href')) # http://example.com/elsie # http://example.com/lacie # http://example.com/tillie `\n```\n\nAnother common task is extracting all the text from a page::\n\n```\n`print(soup.get_text()) # The Dormouse's story # # The Dormouse's story # # Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were # Elsie, # Lacie and # Tillie; # and they lived at the bottom of a well. # # ... `\n```\n\nDoes this look like what you need? If so, read on.\n\n# Installing Beautiful Soup\n\n[](#installing-beautiful-soup)\n\nIf you're using a recent version of Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install Beautiful Soup with the system package manager:\n\n```\n`$ apt-get install python-bs4` `\n```\n\nBeautiful Soup 4 is published through PyPi, so if you can't install it with the system packager, you can install it with `easy_install` or `pip`. The package name is `beautifulsoup4`, and the same package works on Python 2 and Python 3.\n\n```\n`$ easy_install beautifulsoup4` $ pip install beautifulsoup4` `\n```\n\n(The `BeautifulSoup` package is probably `not` what you want. That's the previous major release, `Beautiful Soup 3`_. Lots of software uses BS3, so it's still available, but if you're writing new code you should install `beautifulsoup4`.)\n\nIf you don't have `easy_install` or `pip` installed, you can download the Beautiful Soup 4 source tarball <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/4.x/> and install it with `setup.py`.\n\n```\n`$ python setup.py install` `\n```\n\nIf all else fails, the license for Beautiful Soup allows you to package the entire library with your application. You can download the tarball, copy its `bs4` directory into your application's codebase, and use Beautiful Soup without installing it at all.\n\nI use Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 to develop Beautiful Soup, but it should work with other recent versions.\n\n## About\n\ngit mirror for Beautiful Soup 4.3.2 \n\n### Resources\n\n[ Readme ](#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[ View license ](#License-1-ov-file)\n\n[ Activity](/wention/BeautifulSoup4/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[ **142** stars](/wention/BeautifulSoup4/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[ **4** watching](/wention/BeautifulSoup4/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[ **48** forks](/wention/BeautifulSoup4/forks)\n\n[ Report repository ](/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwention%2FBeautifulSoup4&report=wention+%28user%29)\n\n##  [Releases](/wention/BeautifulSoup4/releases)\n\nNo releases published\n\n##  [Packages 0](/users/wention/packages?repo_name=BeautifulSoup4)\n\nNo packages published \n\n##  [Used by 953k](/wention/BeautifulSoup4/network/dependents)\n\n[\n\n  * ![@MSTRocketDesignTeam](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71146415?s=64&v=4)\n  * ![@crowdbotics-apps](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46582385?s=64&v=4)\n  * ![@AgentArtel](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173503789?s=64&v=4)\n  * ![@ghc-automation-staging-parallel-5-p1](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/168725809?s=64&v=4)\n  * ![@whojayy](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110086697?s=64&v=4)\n  * ![@JBKJB43](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194225256?s=64&v=4)\n  * ![@AlexfromSibir](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171550649?s=64&v=4)\n  * ![@petergtechnologent](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56885448?s=64&v=4)\n\n+ 953,310  ](/wention/BeautifulSoup4/network/dependents)\n\n## Languages\n\n  * [ Python 100.0% ](/wention/BeautifulSoup4/search?l=python)\n\n\n\n## Footer\n\n[ ](https://github.com \"GitHub\") © 2025 GitHub, Inc. \n\n### Footer navigation\n\n  * [Terms](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)\n  * [Privacy](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)\n  * [Security](https://github.com/security)\n  * [Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)\n  * [Docs](https://docs.github.com/)\n  * [Contact](https://support.github.com?tags=dotcom-footer)\n  * Manage cookies \n  * Do not share my personal information \n\n\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time. \n",
