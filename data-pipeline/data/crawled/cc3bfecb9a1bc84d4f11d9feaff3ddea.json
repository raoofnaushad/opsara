The reward model was then used to train a summarization model to align with human preferences. This is the dataset of human feedback that was released for reward modelling. There are two parts of this dataset: `comparisons` and `axis`. In the `comparisons` part, human annotators were asked to choose the best out of two summaries. In the `axis` part, human annotators gave scores on a likert scale for the quality of a summary. The `comparisons` part only has a train and validation split, and the `axis` part only has a test and validation split.\n\nThe summaries used for training the reward model in the paper come from the TL;DR dataset. Additional validation and test data come from the TL;DR dataset, CNN articles, and Daily Mail articles.\n\nFor more information, see the repo [here](https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback#human-feedback-data).\n\n##  [ ](#citation-information) Citation Information \n\n<https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01325>\n\n```\n`@inproceedings{stienon2020learning, author = {Nisan Stiennon and Long Ouyang and Jeff Wu and Daniel M.
