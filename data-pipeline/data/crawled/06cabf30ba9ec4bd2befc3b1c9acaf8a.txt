The world's **fastest** **key value store** is now in the cloud.

Powering the world's most advanced and fastest feature store; [Hopsworks](https://www.hopsworks.ai/the-python-centric-feature-store?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=rondb&utm_id=backlink)

**RonDB** as a managed version provides advanced technology with a user friendly interface. You can launch a cluster in less than a minute. Scales to **hundreds of million of operations per second**. There are no other existing managed databases available today that can do this.

## **Scale-Out**

Scales linearly with mores CPUs on a single host and/or scale-out by adding new data nodes.

## **Battle tested**

An open-source distribution of NDB Cluster by Mikael Ronström, the inventor of NDB Cluster. 

## **Fastest**

Throughput of up to hundreds of millions of read or write ops/seconds and <1ms latency for individual operations.

## **SQL Support**

Access using the MySQL Server API for full compatibility with SQL. Native support for parallelizing queries.

## **The first LATS databasein the cloud.**

RonDB has dedicated support for features required for a high performance online feature store, including **LATS** : low **L** atency, high **A** vailability, high **T** hroughput, scalable **S** torage. RonDB is built with online feature stores in mind providing key capabilities that are unmatched.‍**< 1ms KV lookup>10M KV Lookups/sec>99.999% availability **
