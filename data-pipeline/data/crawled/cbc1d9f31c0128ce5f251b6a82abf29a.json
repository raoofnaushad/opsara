Our current set of evaluations includes MMLU, GPQA, MATH-500, and HumanEval. Different use-cases warrant considering different evaluation tests. \n\nArtificial Analysis Quality Index: Average result across our evaluations covering different dimensions of model intelligence. Currently includes MMLU, GPQA, Math & HumanEval. OpenAI o1 model figures are preliminary and are based on figures stated by OpenAI. See [methodology](/methodology) for more details.\n\nArtificial Analysis Multilingual Index: Reflects performance across a range of languages. Calculated as the average of Multilingual MMLU (general reasoning) and MGSM (mathematical reasoning) evaluation scores. See our[ multilingual capabilities page](/models/multilingual) for further analysis.\n\nMedian across providers: All quality evaluation results above, including Artificial Analysis Quality Index, are represented as the median result across all providers which support each model. \n\n## Quality vs. Price\n\n17 of 95 models selected\n\n+ Add model from specific provider\n\nArtificial Analysis Quality Index, Price: USD per 1M Tokens\n\nMost attractive quadrant\n\n[o1-preview ](/models/o1/providers)\n\n[o1-mini ](/models/o1-mini/providers)\n\n[GPT-4o mini ](/models/gpt-4o-mini/providers)\n\n[GPT-4o (Nov '24) ](/models/gpt-4o/providers)\n\n[Llama 3.3 70B ](/models/llama-3-3-instruct-70b/providers)\n\n[Llama 3.1 405B ](/models/llama-3-1-instruct-405b/providers)\n\n[Llama 3.1 70B ](/models/llama-3-1-instruct-70b/providers)\n\n[Llama 3.1 8B ](/models/llama-3-1-instruct-8b/providers)\n\n[Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sep) ](/models/gemini-1-5-pro/providers)\n\n[Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Oct) ](/models/claude-35-sonnet/providers)\n\n[Claude 3.5 Haiku ](/models/claude-3-5-haiku/providers)\n\n[Mistral Large 2 (Nov '24) ](/models/mistral-large-2/providers)\n\n[Nova Pro ](/models/nova-pro/providers)\n\n[Nova Lite ](/models/nova-lite/providers)\n\n[Nova Micro ](/models/nova-micro/providers)\n\n[DeepSeek V3 ](/models/deepseek-v3/providers)\n\nArtificial Analysis$0.00$5.00$10.00$15.00$20.00$25.00$30.00Price (USD per M Tokens)4550556065707580859095Artificial Analysis Quality IndexLlama 3.1 8BLlama 3.1 8BNova MicroNova MicroLlama 3.1 70BLlama 3.1 70BClaude 3.5 HaikuClaude 3.5 HaikuNova LiteNova LiteGPT-4o miniGPT-4o miniGPT-4o (Nov '24)GPT-4o (Nov '24)Llama 3.1 405BLlama 3.1 405BMistral Large 2 (Nov '24)Mistral Large 2 (Nov '24)Llama 3.3 70BLlama 3.3 70BNova ProNova ProDeepSeek V3DeepSeek V3Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sep)Gemini 1.5 Pro (Sep)Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Oct)Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Oct)o1-minio1-minio1-previewo1-preview\n\nWhile higher quality models are typically more expensive, they do not all follow the same price-quality curve.\n\nArtificial Analysis Quality Index: Average result across our evaluations covering different dimensions of model intelligence.
