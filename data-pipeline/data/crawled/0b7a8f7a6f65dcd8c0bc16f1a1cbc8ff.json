Little Book of ML Metrics](https://www.nannyml.com/metrics). The idea of the book is to be this little handbook that sits on every data scientist's desk for quick reference, from the most well-known metric, ahem, accuracy, to the most obscure ones (looking at you, P4 metric).\n\nTip\n\nYou can preview the latest pre-release version [here](https://github.com/NannyML/The-Little-Book-of-ML-Metrics/releases/download/nightly/main.pdf)\n\n[![The Little Book of ML Metrics](/NannyML/The-Little-Book-of-ML-Metrics/raw/main/book/figures/The_Little_Book_of_Metrics_MAPE.png)](/NannyML/The-Little-Book-of-ML-Metrics/blob/main/book/figures/The_Little_Book_of_Metrics_MAPE.png)\n\n## Why are we writing this book?\n\n[](#why-are-we-writing-this-book)\n\nMachine learning metrics are often overlooked in traditional data science courses and university degrees. This book aims to fill that gap by offering clear, concise, and actionable explanations of the metrics that matter most. Whether you're an aspiring data scientist or an experienced professional, this book will become your go-to reference for understanding and leveraging metrics effectively.\n\n> **Disclaimer:** The book is open-source, which means you can freely access the digital version. However, we also offer a [high-quality printed edition](https://www.nannyml.com/metrics) for purchase. Revenue from printed copies helps support further development and maintenance of the book. Reviewers, contributors, and authors receive revenue sharing through their affiliate links.\n\n## Book Contents\n\n[](#book-contents)\n\nThe book covers a broad range of metrics from different contexts:\n\n  * **Regression**\n  * **Classification**\n  * **Clustering**\n  * **Ranking**\n  * **Computer Vision**\n  * **NLP**\n  * **GenAI**\n  * **Probabilistic**\n  * **Bias and Fairness**\n  * **Business**\n\n\n\n## How to Contribute\n\n[](#how-to-contribute)\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community! As a thank-you for your contributions, each contributor will receive an affiliate link with 10% commission on sales generated through their link. Plus, your name will be included in the book.
