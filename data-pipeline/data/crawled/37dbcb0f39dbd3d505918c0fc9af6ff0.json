What's New (Dec, 2024)\n\n[](#whats-new-dec-2024)\n\nWe have a new release [Recommenders 1.2.1](https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/releases/tag/1.2.1)!\n\nWe fixed a lot of bugs due to dependencies, improved security, reviewed the notebooks and the libraries.\n\n## Introduction\n\n[](#introduction)\n\nRecommenders objective is to assist researchers, developers and enthusiasts in prototyping, experimenting with and bringing to production a range of classic and state-of-the-art recommendation systems.\n\nRecommenders is a project under the [Linux Foundation of AI and Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/).\n\nThis repository contains examples and best practices for building recommendation systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks. The examples detail our learnings on five key tasks:\n\n  * [Prepare Data](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/01_prepare_data): Preparing and loading data for each recommendation algorithm.\n  * [Model](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start): Building models using various classical and deep learning recommendation algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares ([ALS](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/_modules/pyspark/ml/recommendation.html#ALS)) or eXtreme Deep Factorization Machines ([xDeepFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170)).\n  * [Evaluate](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/03_evaluate): Evaluating algorithms with offline metrics.\n  * [Model Select and Optimize](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/04_model_select_and_optimize): Tuning and optimizing hyperparameters for recommendation models.\n  * [Operationalize](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/05_operationalize): Operationalizing models in a production environment on Azure.\n\n\n\nSeveral utilities are provided in [recommenders](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/recommenders) to support common tasks such as loading datasets in the format expected by different algorithms, evaluating model outputs, and splitting training/test data. Implementations of several state-of-the-art algorithms are included for self-study and customization in your own applications. See the [Recommenders documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/microsoft-recommenders/).\n\nFor a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the documents on the [wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/wiki/Documents-and-Presentations).\n\nFor some of the practical scenarios where recommendation systems have been applied, see [scenarios](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/scenarios).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[](#getting-started)\n\nWe recommend [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=environment#conda-environment) for environment management, and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. To install the recommenders package and run an example notebook on Linux/WSL:\n\n```\n# 1. Install gcc if it is not installed already. On Ubuntu, this could done by using the command # sudo apt install gcc # 2. Create and activate a new conda environment conda create -n <environment_name> python=3.9 conda activate <environment_name> # 3. Install the core recommenders package. It can run all the CPU notebooks. pip install recommenders # 4. create a Jupyter kernel python -m ipykernel install --user --name <environment_name> --display-name <kernel_name> # 5. Clone this repo within VSCode or using command line: git clone https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders.git # 6. Within VSCode: # a. Open a notebook, e.g., examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb;  # b. Select Jupyter kernel <kernel_name>; # c. Run the notebook.\n```\n\nFor more information about setup on other platforms (e.g., Windows and macOS) and different configurations (e.g., GPU, Spark and experimental features), see the [Setup Guide](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/SETUP.md).\n\nIn addition to the core package, several extras are also provided, including:\n\n  * `[gpu]`: Needed for running GPU models.\n  * `[spark]`: Needed for running Spark models.\n  * `[dev]`: Needed for development for the repo.\n  * `[all]`: `[gpu]`|`[spark]`|`[dev]`\n  * `[experimental]`: Models that are not thoroughly tested and/or may require additional steps in installation.\n\n\n\n## Algorithms\n\n[](#algorithms)\n\nThe table below lists the recommendation algorithms currently available in the repository.

In this notebook, the MovieLens dataset is split into training/test sets at a 75/25 ratio using a stratified split. A recommendation model is trained using each of the collaborative filtering algorithms below. We utilize empirical parameter values reported in literature [here](http://mymedialite.net/examples/datasets.html). For ranking metrics we use `k=10` (top 10 recommended items). We run the comparison on a Standard NC6s_v2 [Azure DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/data-science-virtual-machines/) (6 vCPUs, 112 GB memory and 1 P100 GPU). Spark ALS is run in local standalone mode. In this table we show the results on Movielens 100k, running the algorithms for 15 epochs.\n\nAlgo | MAP | nDCG@k | Precision@k | Recall@k | RMSE | MAE | R2 | Explained Variance  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n[ALS](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start/als_movielens.ipynb) | 0.004732 | 0.044239 | 0.048462 | 0.017796 | 0.965038 | 0.753001 | 0.255647 | 0.251648  \n[BiVAE](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/cornac_bivae_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.146126 | 0.475077 | 0.411771 | 0.219145 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A  \n[BPR](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/cornac_bpr_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.132478 | 0.441997 | 0.388229 | 0.212522 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A  \n[FastAI](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start/fastai_movielens.ipynb) | 0.025503 | 0.147866 | 0.130329 | 0.053824 | 0.943084 | 0.744337 | 0.285308 | 0.287671  \n[LightGCN](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/lightgcn_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.088526 | 0.419846 | 0.379626 | 0.144336 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A  \n[NCF](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/ncf_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.107720 | 0.396118 | 0.347296 | 0.180775 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A  \n[SAR](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/00_quick_start/sar_movielens.ipynb) | 0.110591 | 0.382461 | 0.330753 | 0.176385 | 1.253805 | 1.048484 | -0.569363 | 0.030474  \n[SVD](/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/surprise_svd_deep_dive.ipynb) | 0.012873 | 0.095930 | 0.091198 | 0.032783 | 0.938681 | 0.742690 | 0.291967 | 0.291971  \n  \n## Contributing\n\n[](#contributing)\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
