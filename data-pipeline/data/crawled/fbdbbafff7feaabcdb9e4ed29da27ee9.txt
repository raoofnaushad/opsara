### [AI Engineering vs ML Engineering: Evolving Roles in the GenAI Era](/blog/ai-engineering-vs-ml-engineering-evolving-roles-genai)

The rise of Generative AI has shifted the roles of AI Engineering and ML Engineering, with AI Engineers integrating generative AI into software products. This shift requires clear ownership boundaries and specialized expertise. A proposed solution is layer separation, separating concerns into two distinct layers: Application (AI Engineers/Software Engineers), Frontend development, Backend APIs, Business logic, User experience, and ML (ML Engineers). This allows AI Engineers to focus on user experience while ML Engineers optimize AI systems.

### [Optimizing LLM Performance and Cost: Squeezing Every Drop of Value](/blog/optimizing-llm-performance-and-cost-squeezing-every-drop-of-value)

This comprehensive guide explores strategies for optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) deployments in production environments, focusing on maximizing performance while minimizing costs. Drawing from real-world examples and the LLMOps database, it examines three key areas: model selection and optimization techniques like knowledge distillation and quantization, inference optimization through caching and hardware acceleration, and cost optimization strategies including prompt engineering and self-hosting decisions. The article provides practical insights for technical professionals looking to balance the power of LLMs with operational efficiency.

Practical lessons on prompt engineering in production settings, drawn from real LLMOps case studies. It covers key aspects like designing structured prompts (demonstrated by Canva's incident review system), implementing iterative refinement processes (shown by Fiddler's documentation chatbot), optimizing prompts for scale and efficiency (exemplified by Assembled's test generation system), and building robust management infrastructure (as seen in Weights & Biases' versioning setup). Throughout these examples, the focus remains on systematic improvement through testing, human feedback, and error analysis, while balancing performance with operational costs and complexity.
