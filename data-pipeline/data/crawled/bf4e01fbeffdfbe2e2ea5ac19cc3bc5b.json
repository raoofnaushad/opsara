Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD.\n\n  * Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.\n  * Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a graph (DAG).\n  * Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.\n  * Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.\n\n\n\n## Why Argo Workflows?\n\n  * Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.\n  * Cloud agnostic and can run on any Kubernetes cluster.\n  * Easily orchestrate highly parallel jobs on Kubernetes.\n  * Argo Workflows puts a cloud-scale supercomputer at your fingertips!\n\n\n\n[ View Docs ](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)[ Get Started ](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/)\n\n[](https://github.com/argoproj \"Follow us on GitHub\")[](/community/join-slack/)\n\n2025 Â© Argo Project Authors.
