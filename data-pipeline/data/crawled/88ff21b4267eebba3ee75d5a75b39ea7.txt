## What Is Edge AI?

Edge AI is the practice of deploying AI models and algorithms directly on edge devices, which are devices located at the network's periphery, close to where data is generated and actions need to be taken.

These devices encompass a wide range, from powerful edge servers to resource-constrained IoT sensors, and include familiar examples like smartphones, smart home appliances, autonomous vehicles, and even industrial robots.

Recent advancements in AI, such as the development of smaller and more efficient language models like [GPT-4o Mini](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/gpt-4o-mini), [Llama 3.1 8B](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/llama-3-1-405b-meta-ai), and [Gemma 2 2B](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/fine-tuning-gemma-2), are further accelerating the adoption of edge AI.

This shift to edge AI offers several advantages:

  * Speed: Decisions and actions happen in real-time, right where the data is generated. This is necessary for applications like self-driving cars or medical devices that can't afford delays caused by sending data to the cloud for processing.
  * Privacy: Sensitive data can be analyzed locally without needing to be sent to the cloud, enhancing security and privacy.
  * Reliability: Edge AI reduces dependency on a constant internet connection, making it more reliable in areas with limited or unstable connectivity.
  * Efficiency: Processing data locally reduces the bandwidth required to send everything to the cloud, saving both energy and costs.



## How Edge AI Works

To understand how edge AI works, we need to understand its main components and the processes involved.

### Key components

Edge AI comprises three main components: edge devices, AI models, and communication.

#### Edge devices

Edge devices encompass a wide range of hardware, from powerful edge servers capable of handling substantial computational loads to highly resource-constrained IoT sensors designed for specific tasks.

These devices include smartphones, drones, autonomous vehicles, industrial robots, and smart home devices, all of which can run AI models locally to process data in real time. Some hardware manufacturers, like NVIDIA and Intel, even provide hardware support for [deploying ML models](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/mlops-deployment-and-life-cycling) on the edge.

#### AI models

Edge AI employs various types of AI models, including [machine learning](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/mlops-concepts), [deep learning](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/deep-learning-in-python), and computer vision algorithms, optimized for efficient execution on edge devices.

These models are tailored to operate within the constraints of edge environments, ensuring that they can perform effectively despite limited processing power, memory, and storage.

For instance, models like GPT-4o Mini and Llama 3.1 8B are specifically designed to be lightweight and efficient, making them suitable for edge deployments.

#### Communication

Efficient data exchange between edge devices and the cloud is facilitated by communication protocols such as MQTT and REST APIs. These protocols enable seamless connectivity and data transfer, allowing synchronized operations between edge devices and central systems when necessary. These protocols allow the transfer of information in compressed form in an almost lossless fashion to keep the crucial information intact.

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. It uses a publish-subscribe model, allowing devices to send (publish) and receive (subscribe) messages without needing a direct connection. This makes MQTT ideal for IoT applications where devices need to communicate efficiently and reliably.

REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to access and use data. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each call from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request. This makes REST APIs scalable and suitable for various web services and applications, including those involving edge devices.

### The Process

The workflow that powers edge AI involves three steps: data collection, data processing, and action.

![Edge AI processes](https://media.datacamp.com/legacy/v1723043760/image_51de06a284.png)

#### Data collection

Edge devices continuously collect data from sensors, cameras, or other sources, providing a steady stream of information. This data can range from environmental metrics and health parameters to video feeds and audio recordings, forming the basis for real-time analysis.

A great example of data collection is how your smartwatch collects the number of steps you took today.

#### Data processing

AI models deployed on edge devices process the collected data locally. This step involves analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights, detect patterns, and make predictions using AI models without relying on cloud resources.

Local processing ensures that decisions can be made quickly, such as a self-driving car determining which lane to choose in real-time.

#### Real-Time Action

Based on the AI model's output, edge devices can take immediate action. These actions might include triggering alarms, adjusting the path, or sending data to the cloud for further analysis. The ability to act in real-time is essential for scenarios requiring instant responses, such as security systems or medical devices.
