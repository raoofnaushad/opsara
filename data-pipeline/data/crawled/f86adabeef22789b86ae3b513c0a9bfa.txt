# Your GenAI has a data problem

80% of enterprise data is locked in complex documents, untapped and unused. Every day, valuable insights remain buried in PDFs, presentations, and emails you haven't been able to access. Until now. Unstructured automatically transforms complex, unstructured data into clean, structured data for GenAI applications. Automatically. Continuously. Effortlessly.

# Trusted by 73% of the Fortune 1000

How We Do It

## We connect enterprise data to LLMs, no matter the source.

Our enterprise-grade connectors capture data wherever it lives, so we can transform it into AI-friendly JSON files for companies who are eager to fold AI into their business. You can count on Unstructured to deliver data that's curated, clean of artifacts, and most importantly, LLM-ready.

### What Makes Us Different

## Any document. Any file type. Any layout.

Large language models thrive when powered with clean, curated data. But most of this data is hard to find, hard to work with, and hard to clean. We make it easy.
